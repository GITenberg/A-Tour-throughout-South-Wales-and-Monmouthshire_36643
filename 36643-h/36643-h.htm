<p>The intention of this Work is, to point out and describe such
objects as command general interest throughout the
country.&mdash;The usual plan of Tours only comprising a
particular route, unless that precise line be retraced, a Tourist
is obliged to encumber himself with several books, to enable him
to gain all the information that he requires.&nbsp; The Author
has felt this inconvenience in several excursions through Great
Britain; and has therefore selected from the best authorities an
account of those few parts which he had not an opportunity of
visiting; in order that this Work may exhibit a general survey of
Southern Cambria.</p>

1</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">GENERAL OBSERVATIONS&mdash;A SKETCH OF WELCH
HISTORY&mdash;ANCIENT BUILDINGS.</p>
<h3>SECT. I.</h3>
<p>In making the Tour of South Wales and Monmouthshire, the
<i>Admirer</i> of <i>picturesque beauty</i> dwells with peculiar
pleasure on a tract of country comprising the greater part of
Monmouthshire, and bordering the Severn and Bristol channel, to
the western limits of Pembrokeshire.&nbsp; In this enchanting
district, a succession of bold hills, clothed with wild forests,
or ornamental plantations and delightful valleys, present
themselves in constant variety: <a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>many fine estuaries and rivers,
picturesque towns, and princely ruins, also adorn the scene,
whose charms are inconceivably heightened by the contiguity of
the Bristol channel, which washes the coast; in some places
receding into capacious bays; in others, advancing into rocky
promontories of the most imposing grandeur.</p>
<p><i>The Statistical Enquirer</i> finds equal subject of
gratification, in the uncommon fertility of several valleys, and
the woody treasures of numerous hills, bearing myriads of oaks,
and other first-rate timber-trees.&nbsp; The mineral wealth of
the country, and its convenient coast for traffic, are likewise
subjects of high consideration; and, while the statist applauds
the late rapid strides of manufactures and commerce in this
district, he may discover sources hitherto latent for their
increase.</p>
<p><i>The Historian</i> cannot fail of being interested while
treading on the ground where Britons made their latest and most
vigorous efforts for independence, against successive invaders;
nor <i>the Antiquary</i>, while traversing a country replete with
Monuments of the Druidical ages; military works of the Romans,
Britons, <a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>Saxons, and Normans; and the venerable relics of numerous
religious foundations.</p>
<p>Beyond this stripe of country, from ten to twenty miles in
width, forming the southern extremity of Wales, and an
intermixture of rich scenery (particularly in the neighbourhood
of Brecon), with prevailing dreariness on the eastern frontier,
South-Wales exhibits a tedious extent of hills without majesty,
valleys overrun with peat bogs, and unprofitable moors.&nbsp;
Beside the superb ruins of St. David&rsquo;s, the course of the
Tivy near Cardigan, and the scenery about the Devil&rsquo;s
Bridge, it has little to entice the attention of the tourist: the
towns, for the most part, are miserably poor, and travelling
accommodations very uncertain; the roads, too, are wretched
beyond any thing that a mere English traveller ever
witnessed.&nbsp; It is, therefore, a subject of no small
gratification, that the chief beauties of South-Wales are found
in a compact route; abounding with good towns, respectable
accommodations, and very fair roads.&nbsp; This part of the
country may be explored in a close carriage, though the better
mode of travelling is, certainly, on horse-back.&nbsp; The
pedestrian may claim peculiar <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>advantages in his way of getting on;
but I do not conceive, that a man enduring the fatigue of
trudging day after day through miry roads, can maintain an
exhilaration of spirits congenial with the beauties that surround
him.</p>
<h3>SECT. II.</h3>
<p>The geographical situation and present limits of Wales are
unnecessary to be here described.&nbsp; Of its history, the first
certain accounts that we collect are on the invasion of the
Romans, when Wales appears to have been divided into three
principalities: the Silures, the Ordovices, and the
Dimit&aelig;.&nbsp; The Silures possessed all that tract of
country bounded by the Severn, the Tame, and the Towey; which,
comprehending the counties of Monmouth, Glamorgan, Brecknock,
Radnor, Hereford, and part of Gloucester, Worcester, and
Caermarthen shires, comprised the greater part of
South-Wales.&nbsp; The Dimit&aelig; inhabited that part of
South-Wales westward of the Towey; and the Ordovices,
North-Wales, including Anglesea.</p>
<p>The Romans having subdued <i>Britannia Prima</i>, <i>i.e.</i>
the Southern part of England, <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>advanced to the conquest of Wales, by
them denominated <i>Britannia Secunda</i>; in this, however, they
met with an unlooked-for opposition; the inhabitants were
vigorous and brave; and the country, wildly piled together with
mountains, forests, and morasses, presented an aggregation of
difficulties, that would have discouraged a people less ardent in
their enterprizes: nor did they succeed, until after a long
warfare and a severe loss.&nbsp; The Silures and Dimit&aelig;
fell under the yoke in the reign of Vespasian, when they were
vanquished by <i>Julius Frontinus</i>.&nbsp; The Ordovices were
not finally subdued until the time of his successor,
<i>Agricola</i>, who, according to Tacitus, exterminated the
whole nation.</p>
<p>The Romans retained possession of this country until A.D. 408,
when they withdrew their legions, and the most warlike of the
British youth, for the defence of their central dominions.&nbsp;
The inroads of the Scots and Picts, which immediately followed,
do not appear to have materially affected the Welch; nor did the
Saxons, though at constant war with them for several centuries,
acquire any settled dominion in the country: yet they more than
once partially overran <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>Wales, obliging it to pay tribute; and
in the reign of Edward the confessor, Harold, at the head of a
great army, entering Wales, defeated Prince Griffith, sovereign
of North-Wales, and, establishing himself in Gwent <a
name="citation6"></a><a href="#footnote6"
class="citation">[6]</a> (Monmouthshire), began a Palace at
Portswit, which was, however, destroyed by Griffith before its
completion.</p>
<p>From the departure of the Romans, in 408, to the inroads of
the Anglo-Norman chieftains in the eleventh and twelfth
centuries, Wales was divided into numerous petty sovereignties or
lordships, of varying name and extent, but tributary to an
imperial Prince; though sometimes that dignity was split into two
or three branches.&nbsp; These chiefs were usually at war with
each other, or with their Princes, who seldom obtained tribute
when their means of enforcing it was questionable.</p>
<p>The Anglo-Norman dominion in Wales was brought about in a
manner wholly different from former conquests.&nbsp; William the
First and his successors, finding sufficient employment in
securing their English possessions, invited their chiefs, holding
lands in the <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>neighbourhood of Wales, to make incursions against the
Welch lords, upon their separate interests.&nbsp; The Norman
leaders thereupon, by creating feuds among the native powers,
siding with one or the other party, and breaking with them on
convenient opportunities, contrived to fix themselves in various
parts of Wales; whence their conquests extending, by degrees,
overspread the greater part of the country.&nbsp; The lands thus
obtained became the property of the conquerors, who, under the
title of lords marchers, were allowed to exercise an uncontrolled
jurisdiction within their demesnes: but power acquired on such
principles could only be retained by force; every petty despot
secured himself in a fortress, and hence arose the extraordinary
number of castles with which Wales is crowded, amounting,
according to a native author, <a name="citation7"></a><a
href="#footnote7" class="citation">[7]</a> to 143.&nbsp; The
Welch princes still held a considerable tract of country,
frequently overthrew the intruders, and even carried their arms
into England; but in the defeat of the brave Llewelyn, by Edward
the First, Wales lost every remnant of its independence, <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>and became
definitively united to the crown of England.</p>
<p>In the reign of Henry the Eighth Wales was divided into twelve
shires, and Monmouthshire was included among the English
counties; the feudal despotism of the lords-marchers was then
abolished; and Wales, participating in the equal shelter of
English jurisprudence, has proved itself as zealous in defending
the common interests of the empire, as it was formerly
conspicuous in struggling for its particular freedom.</p>
<h3>SECT. III.</h3>
<p>Among the numerous memorials of history and antiquity which
distinguish Wales, castles and religious buildings possess the
chief claim to attention; and, as Wales is an admirable field for
the study of the civil and military architecture that prevailed
in the middle ages, I shall give a slight sketch of the progress
of those arts, so far as it seems applicable to the present
purpose.</p>
<p>On the overthrow of the Romans by the Goths and Vandals, the
arts vanished before the scourge of war; and the standard mode of
architecture which adorned the Greek and <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>Roman empires
could no longer be executed in its original perfection.&nbsp; The
general forms, indeed, were imitated, but without an observance
of symmetry: the execution was rough and clumsy; the pillars were
excessively thick, and the arches heavy; and where ornament was
attempted the performance was very uncouth.&nbsp; Such was the
state of architecture (a mere corruption of the Roman) that
succeeded the devastations of the Goths, and has been called
<i>Saxon</i> and <i>Norman</i>: the term Gothic, however, would
certainly be more appropriate.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the twelfth century, a new style of
architecture made its appearance, distinguished by pointed arches
and clustered columns <a name="citation9"></a><a
href="#footnote9" class="citation">[9]</a>.&nbsp; Though at first
coldly <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>received, and but sparingly introduced among the rounded
arches and massive columns called Saxon, it soon gained an
undisputed footing.</p>
<p>About the latter end of the reign of Henry the Third, we find
it acquire a more ornamental and distinct character.&nbsp; The
pillars, which before were rounds and encircled with slender
detached shafts, were then formed in entire reeded columns; the
arched roofs also, which only exhibited the main springers, then
became intersected with numerous ramifications and
transomes.&nbsp; The decorations continued to increase until
toward the close of Henry the Eighth&rsquo;s reign, when the
light of science again dawned over Europe, and the relics of
Greece and Rome were rightly considered as models of genuine
taste; the classic elegance of the five Orders then appeared,
intermixed with the Gothic; it soon became universal, and is now
adopted in all superior buildings throughout Europe.&nbsp;
Further characteristics of style might be pointed <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>out, and
lesser variations defined: but I do not presume to inform the
antiquary; and the distinctions already drawn will be sufficient
for the cursory tourist.</p>
<p><i>Castles</i> appear of no generally chosen figure, except
such were founded by the Romans, who preferred that of an oblong
square, unless there were special reasons to the contrary.&nbsp;
Small castles consisted of a single court, or ward, whose sides
were usually flanked by towers.&nbsp; The great hall, chapel, and
domestic apartments, built from the outer wall into the court,
occupied one or more sides.&nbsp; The citadel, called also the
Keep and Dungeon, was a tower of eminent strength, wherein the
Garrison made their last stand, and where prisoners were
sometimes confined: the citadel was often detached from the
walls, and built on an artificial mound encircled with a
ditch.&nbsp; The barracks for the soldiers in garrison was
generally a range of building near the gatehouse, or principal
entrance.&nbsp; The latter building contained apartments for the
Officers of the castle, and the portal was furnished with one,
two, or three portcullisses. <a name="citation11"></a><a
href="#footnote11" class="citation">[11]</a>&nbsp; <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>A wet or dry
moat surrounded the whole; and, advanced before the drawbridge
that crossed it, there was often an outwork called a
barbican.&nbsp; Large castles were only a repetition of these
courts upon somewhat of a larger scale, connected with each other
(Chepstow castle consists of four).&nbsp; In fortresses of the
first class, an extensive embattled wall sometimes encircled the
mass of fortification already described, at some distance,
inclosing a considerable tract of ground, as at Caerphilly in
Glamorganshire. <a name="citation12"></a><a href="#footnote12"
class="citation">[12]</a>&nbsp; Castle walls appear in some
instances built of solid masonry; but their general construction
is of grout work.&nbsp; For this purpose, two slight walls were
built parallel, from six to twelve feet asunder; the interval was
then filled up with loose stones and rubbish, and the <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>whole
cemented together with a great quantity of fluid (according to
some authors boiling) mortar: the mass soon acquired a sufficient
firmness, and in the present day it possesses the adhesion of
solid rock.&nbsp; This method was used by the Romans, and adopted
by succeeding ages; but the arches were turned, and the angles
coigned with hewn stones, which, after the Conquest, were brought
from Caen in Normandy.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">VOYAGE FROM BRISTOL TO SWANSEA&mdash;SWANSEA
CASTLE&mdash;MANUFACTORIES&mdash;WELCH BATHING&mdash;OSTERMOUTH,
PENRICE, AND PENNARTH CASTLES&mdash;SEAT OF MR.
TALBOT&mdash;ARTHUR&rsquo;S STONE, A LARGE CROMLECH.</p>
<p>In company with a brother artist, I entered <span
class="smcap">Bristol</span> with an intention of commencing my
Cambrian tour in the neighbourhood of Chepstow; but an
unthought-of attraction induced us to relinquish this
project.</p>
<p>Returning from a ramble through the town, by the quay, we were
agreeably amused with a fleet of vessels that was about to quit
the river with the ebbing tide; some of them were already in full
sail floating down the stream, and others getting under
weigh.&nbsp; The spirited exertions of the seamen, and the
anxious movements of numerous spectators, <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>devoting
their attention to friends or freight, gave animation to the
scene, which was rendered particularly cheerful by the delightful
state of the morning.&nbsp; On a sudden we were saluted with a
duet of French-horns from a small sloop in the river; a very
indifferent performance to be sure, yet it was pleasing.&nbsp;
This sloop was bound to <span class="smcap">Swansea</span>; and
we learned that the wind was so directly favourable, that the
voyage would in all probability be completed the same
afternoon.&nbsp; We were now strongly disposed for an aquatic
excursion; nor did the laughing broad faces of about a dozen
Welch girls, passengers, alarm us from our purpose: so by an
exertion we collected our portmanteaus and some refreshments in
due time, and engaged in the voyage.</p>
<p>Leaving Bristol, and its romantic but ruined suburb <span
class="smcap">Clifton</span>, we entered upon the remarkable
scenery of St. <span class="smcap">Vincent&rsquo;s</span>
Rocks.&nbsp; A bolder pass than is here formed I scarcely
remember to have seen, even in the most mountainous parts of
Great Britain: on one side, a huge rock rises in naked majesty
perpendicularly from the river, to the height of some hundred
feet; the immense surface is <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>tinted with the various hues of grey,
red, and yellow, and diversified by a few patches of shrubs,
moss, and creeping lichens.&nbsp; A range of rocks equal in
magnitude, but of less precipitous ascent, clothed with dark wild
forest trees and underwood, forms the opposite boundary of the
river; attempering the menacing aspect of impendent cliffs, with
the softer features of sylvan hills.</p>
<p>The grandeur of the river&rsquo;s banks diminishes until near
the Avon&rsquo;s junction with the Severn; when the commanding
height of Kingsweston-hill, adorned with the groves, lawns, and
plantations of Lord Clifford&rsquo;s park, rises conspicuously
eminent, and engages a parting interest.&nbsp; We soon entered
the Severn, here an expansive estuary, and so far a noble object;
but deriving little importance from its shores, which, except in
the neighbourhood of Aust, are a mere undulation of corn-fields
and pastures.&nbsp; The display of cultivation, though
gratifying, is certainly inferior in picturesque merit to the
grand features of cliffs and mountains which distinguish the
shores of <span class="smcap">Pembrokeshire</span>, and the
western coast of Wales.</p>
<p><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>For
some time we were well entertained with our voyage; when
satisfied with external objects, we found amusement in the
cooped-up circle of our companions, and entered upon a general
meal, without the assistance of knives or plates, with much good
humour: nor was there a lack of wit, if we might judge from the
continued bursts of laughter that sallied on the occasion.&nbsp;
But the scene presently changed: the wind, at first so
favourable, shifted to the opposite point, increasing from a
pleasant breeze to a fresh gale; the sun no longer played on the
surface of the water; the sky became overcast; and &ldquo;the
waves curled darkly against the vessel.&rdquo;&nbsp; From the
seamen, with looks of disappointment, we learned, that the
prospect of a short voyage was at an end; and that, if the wind
continued as it was, we might be kept at sea for several days:
the badness of the weather increased towards evening, when a
deluging rain came down, and continued the whole night.&nbsp;
This calamity was further aggravated by a noisy old woman on
board, who grated our ears with a horrible scream whenever a wave
broke over the vessel, or a flash of lightning illuminated the
scenery of <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>the storm; filling up the intervals with the cheering
narrative of ships that were lost in the very track of our
voyage.&nbsp; It was to no purpose that we endeavoured to joke
away her fears, or to make them less eloquent; but Time, that
great resolver of difficulties, transferring the disorder of her
imagination to her stomach, quieted her alarm.&nbsp; At length
the increasing rain forced every one for shelter towards the
cabin: this was a hole about two yards by one and a half; not
quite the latter dimension in height, and filthy to a degree that
I shall not attempt to describe: into this place as many were
squeezed as it could possibly contain.</p>
<p>Among our female companions were two genteel young Welch-women
of considerable personal attractions, whose vivacity and
good-nature had essentially contributed to the entertainment of
the day: one of these was peculiarly bewitching; her&rsquo;s
was</p>
<blockquote><p>&mdash;the faultless form<br />
Shap&rsquo;d by the hand of harmony; the cheek<br />
Where the live crimson, through the native white<br />
Soft-shooting, o&rsquo;er, the face diffuses bloom,<br />
And ev&rsquo;ry nameless grace; the parted lip,<br />
Like the red rose-bud moist with morning dew,<br />
<a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>Breathing
delight; and, under flowing jet,<br />
The neck slight-shaded, and the swelling breast;<br />
The look resistless, piercing to the soul.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These damsels preferring the certainty of a wetting upon deck
to the chance of suffocation in the cabin, we made it our
business to defend them as much as possible from &ldquo;the
pelting of the pitiless storm.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our travelling coats
were fashionably large; so that each of us was able completely to
shelter one, without exposing ourselves; a bottle of brandy too,
that we had fortunately provided, helped to counteract the
inclemency of the weather, and we were for some time thoroughly
comfortable.&nbsp; The rain at length, penetrating our coverings,
obliged us to seek a fresh resource; but to discover one was no
easy matter; for the cabin had not a chink unoccupied, and there
was not a dry sail on board to make use of.&nbsp; In this
predicament it fortunately occurred to one of the ladies, that
before the hatchway was closed she observed sufficient room in
the hold for three or four persons who were not very bulky to lie
down: to this place we gained admittance; and, although the
angles of chests and packages formed a very inappropriate couch
for <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>the
tender limbs of our friends, yet the retreat proved highly
gratifying; and, after a short time spent in pleasing
conversation, we enjoyed a refreshing sleep.&mdash;Unhallowed
thoughts, be silent! voluptuous imaginations, conjure not up,
from this pressure of circumstances, motives or actions that are
unholy!&nbsp; It is true, the girls had charms that might warm an
anchorite, and were filled with the glowing sensations of
youthful passion; yet they were virtuous; nor had the tourists,
although encountering temptation, a wish to endanger the
possessors of qualities so lovely for a transitory enjoyment.</p>
<p>When we issued from our burrow the next morning, the rain
continued; but the wind had abated, and become more
favourable.&nbsp; The other passengers remained in the cabin, and
nothing can be imagined more distressing than their
situation.&nbsp; No less than ten women had squeezed themselves
into the hole, where they lay all of a heap, like fish in a
basket.&nbsp; The heat and confinement had rendered the sickness
general: I shall forbear to describe the evidence of its effects;
but briefly remark, that, overcome by pain and fatigue, they
appeared all in a sound sleep, half released <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>from their
clothes, and with such an intermixture of heads, bodies, and
limbs, that it required some ingenuity to trace the relation of
the several parts.&nbsp; The two old French-horn players were
lying at the door soaking in the rain, but also asleep.&nbsp;
From such a scene we gladly withdrew, and in a few hours found
ourselves at the entrance of <span class="smcap">Swansea
Bay</span>, finely encircled with high varied hills; on our left
were the two insulated rocks called the Mumbles, at a small
distance from the main land, where the whitened town of <span
class="smcap">Ostermouth</span> <a name="citation21"></a><a
href="#footnote21" class="citation">[21]</a> appeared issuing
from the water, beneath a lofty dark hill.&nbsp; At the bottom of
the bay, the superior extent of Swansea lined the shore, backed
by an atmosphere of cloudy vapours produced from the numerous
furnaces in its neighbourhood.&nbsp; At length I trod on Cambrian
ground, and paid my half crown, with a willing engagement to
forfeit a hundred times the sum, <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>if ever I should be again caught on
board of a Swansea Hoy. <a name="citation22"></a><a
href="#footnote22" class="citation">[22]</a></p>
<p>Swansea is a tolerably neat town, although irregularly
built.&nbsp; It has long been a winter residence of the
neighbouring gentry, and a favourite resort in summer for
bathing; but its increasing opulence arises principally from the
prosperity of its manufactures and commerce.</p>
<p>In company with Major Jones, a worthy magistrate of the town,
to whose polite attention I stand indebted for much local
information, I obtained a complete survey of <span
class="smcap">Swansea Castle</span>, (situated in the middle of
the town), which, although much contracted from its former grand
dimensions, is still of considerable extent.&nbsp; The principal
feature of the building is, a massive quadrangular tower,
remarkable for a range of light circular arches, encircling the
top, and supporting <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>a parapet, which forms a connexion with turrets at each
angle.&nbsp; This parapet affords a pleasing bird&rsquo;s-eye
view of the town and surrounding country.&nbsp; The tenantable
parts of the castle comprise the town-hall; a poor-house; a jail;
a new market-house; numerous store-cellars; a blacksmith&rsquo;s
and other shops and habitations; a Roman Catholic chapel; and a
pigeon-house.&nbsp; The Gothic structure has been so far
metamorphosed in its application to these purposes, that it is
almost impossible to trace the original plan of the building; but
the large apartment used for Romish worship has been either the
baronial hall or the chapel: I think, the former.</p>
<p>During my stay in Swansea, an intoxicated man fell asleep on
the parapet of the castle, and, rolling off, fell to the ground
at the depth of near 80 feet.&nbsp; The poor fellow was a servant
in the castle: and, missing his room in winding up the turreted
stair-case, unconsciously extended his journey to the summit of
the castle.&nbsp; Nothing broke his fall (unless the roof of a
low shed reared against the wall, and which he went clearly
through, <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>may be considered as a favourable impediment), and yet,
incredible as it may seem! the only effect produced on the man,
was a slight broken head, and a restoration of his
faculties.&nbsp; He bound up his head himself, made the best of
his way to a public-house, took a little more ale, and then went
soberly to bed.&nbsp; I should scarcely have believed this
miraculous escape, had I not seen the broken tiles and rafters
through which he fell, and heard the attestations of numerous
witnesses of the accident.</p>
<p>Swansea Castle was built A.D. 1113, by Henry Beaumont, Earl of
Warwick, a Norman leader who conquered Gowerland, a tract of
country bounded by the Neath and Loughor rivers, from the Welch;
but it was soon after besieged by Griffith ap Rhys ap Theodore, a
native chief, and a great part of the out-buildings
destroyed.&nbsp; It is now the property of the Duke of Beaufort,
Lord paramount of Gower.</p>
<p>A large tract of country northward of Swansea is covered with
coal, copper, and iron-works, the operations of which are much
facilitated by a canal passing among them.&nbsp; The dismal gloom
of the manufactories, <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>hanging over the river Tawe, is
pleasingly contrasted by the whitened walls of their appendant
villages, springing from the dark sides of the hills that rise
above the river.&nbsp; Conspicuous above the other resorts of the
manufacturers is <span class="smcap">Morristown</span>, a neat
newly-created village; and on the summit of a steep hill
Morristown castle, a quadrangular building, which is the
habitation of upwards of thirty families; these buildings owe
their origin to Mr. Morris, a gentleman, who, in partnership with
Mr. Lockwood, conducts one of the leading works.&nbsp; The
introduction of Major Jones obtained me a view of Messrs.
Freeman&rsquo;s copper manufactory: we took care to be there at
noon, when the furnaces are tapped and all the interesting
processes gone through.&nbsp; The effect in passing through these
dismal buildings, contrasted by the vivid glare of the furnaces,
and the liquid fire of the pouring metal, is to a stranger very
striking.&nbsp; I was much surprized at the quantity of condensed
sulphureous vapour that yellowed the roof of the building.&nbsp;
Sulphur often forms the greatest bulk of the ore; yet no means
are employed to collect the vapour, <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>which might easily be managed, and
could not fail of turning to a source of profit: at the same
time, it would save the health of the workmen, and spare the
vegetation, which appears stinted for a considerable distance by
the noxious effluvia.</p>
<p>We left these sulphureous chambers to enjoy a purer air on the
sea-shore, where another curiosity awaited us.&nbsp; As we were
strolling on the sands, about a mile above the town, we remarked
a group of figures, in birth-day attire, gamboling in the water:
not suspecting that they were women, we passed carelessly on; but
how great was our surprize, on approaching them, to find that the
fact did not admit of a doubt.&nbsp; We had not paused a minute,
before they all came running toward us, with a menacing tone and
countenance, that would seem to order us away.&nbsp; Though we
did not understand their British sentences, we obeyed, and very
hastily too, on finding a volley of stones rattling about our
ears.&nbsp; This hostile demonstration, we afterwards found,
arose from a suspicion that we were going to remove their
clothes, a piece of waggery often practised by the visitants of
Swansea, to enjoy their <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>running <i>nudiores ovo</i>.&nbsp;
The girls knew that we were not their countrymen, or we should
have passed unconcerned; unless, indeed, acquaintances, who would
have made their usual salutation, and perhaps joined in the
party&rsquo;s amusement.&nbsp; In our subsequent rambles on the
beach these liberal exhibitions of Cambrian beauty afforded us
many pleasing studies of unsophisticated nature:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Graceful, cleanly, smooth and round;<br />
All in Venus&rsquo; girdle bound.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From Swansea we made an excursion across the sands to
Ostermouth castle, about four miles distant, situated on an
eminence near the coast.&nbsp; The principal walls of this ruin
are little injured by time, and most of the apartments may be
readily distinguished; the general figure is polygonal, and the
ramparts are conspicuously lofty, but unflanked by towers, except
at the entrance: a profusion of ivy overspreading the ruin rather
conceals than adorns it.&nbsp; This building is supposed to have
been erected by the Norman conqueror of Gowerland, and has almost
ever since remained the property of that Lordship.</p>
<p><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>From
some high hills behind Ostermouth, an extensive view is obtained
over the peninsula of Gower, and the two noble bays of Swansea
and Caermarthen, which its projection divides: the general aspect
of the peninsula is wild and dreary.&nbsp; Not far distant, near
the little bay of Oxwich, are the ruins of Pennarth castle, a
fortress built soon after the Beaumonts conquered Gowerland; and
on the opposite side of the bay stands the more picturesque ruin
of Penrice castle; so called after the Penrice&rsquo;s, a Norman
family that settled there in the reign of Edward the First.&nbsp;
This castle is comprised in an extensive domain belonging to Mr.
Talbot, which occupies a great part of the peninsula; and here
Mr. Talbot has erected an elegant villa, with all the appendant
beauties of wood and lawn, lake, and promenade.&nbsp; But, unless
with a view to improve the estate, one can scarcely imagine what
motive could induce this gentleman to desert his former residence
at Margam, possessing all the allurements of favoured nature, and
situated in the midst of an agreeable neighbourhood, to force
exotic elegance upon a bleak unfrequented coast, <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>and fix his
abode far from the usual haunts of society.</p>
<p>About three miles northward of Penrice, upon a mountain called
Cum Bryn, near Llanridian, is a table-like monument, or cromlech,
<a name="citation29"></a><a href="#footnote29"
class="citation">[29]</a> called Arthur&rsquo;s stone: it
consists of a huge flat stone, supposed to weigh near twenty
tons, supported upon six or seven others about five feet in
height; the smaller stones are placed in a circle.&mdash;A few
miles farther, near the mouth of the Loughor, is Webley castle,
which was described to me as a place of considerable antique
strength, and as being still entire and partially
inhabited.&nbsp; The difficulty of access to this castle, and its
out-of-the-way situation, prevented our visiting it; similar
reasons also prevented our seeing a curiosity at Wormshead point,
a bold promontory jutting far into the sea, and divided from the
main land at high-water by the sea&rsquo;s overflowing its low
isthmus.&nbsp; Near the <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>extremity of the point is a cleft in
the ground, in which if dust or sand be thrown, it will be
returned back into the air; and a person applying his ear to the
crevice will hear a deep noise, like the blowing of a large pair
of bellows: this effect is reasonably attributed to the
concussions of the waves of the sea in the cavernous hollows of
the cliff.&nbsp; An old author, I think Giraldus Cambrensis,
speaks of a similar phenomenon in Barry island, near the coast
between Cardiff and Cowbridge; but at present no such effect is
produced at that place.</p>

<p
class="gutsumm">LOUGHOR&mdash;LLANELLY&mdash;PEMBREE-HILL&mdash;KIDWELLY,
AND ITS CASTLE.</p>
<p>Having satisfied ourselves with the peninsula of Gower, we
entered upon a zigzag excursion, round the coast of South-Wales,
to its northern boundary, purposing to return to Swansea by a
midland route.&nbsp; My friend had bought an excellent travelling
horse, though aged, and a little foundered, for twelve
pounds.&nbsp; I was not so fortunate; the few others that we met
with for sale, were miserable poneys, and at a price double their
value in London: I was, therefore, constrained to engage a poor
little hack, at two guineas for a fortnight&rsquo;s use; and thus
mounted we set forward over a high romantic district to Loughor,
the Leucarium of Antoninus, now a poor village; but still
exhibiting the ruined keep of its castle, on a raised mount
surrounded by a moat.&nbsp; From this <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>place, soiled with the filth of
neighbouring collieries, we had a river to ford to the opposite
shore.&nbsp; This task is by no means enviable; for, in addition
to fording a rapid current over a rough stoney bottom, large
hollows are formed by vessels at low water, which, not appearing,
sometimes entrap the unsuspecting traveller, who may think
himself well off if he escape with only a ducking: we thanked our
stars when we got across; and, wading through a miserable road,
and a region of collieries, arrived at <span
class="smcap">Llanelly</span> (pronounced Llanithly).&nbsp; About
half way between the ford and this town, we observed Capel Ddewy,
a small ruin, picturesquely accompanied by a yew-tree; and near
it the remains of some deserted furnaces.</p>
<p>In this ride we proceeded at an uncertainty, till we were
fortunately assisted by an agreeable matron, who was churning at
the door of her cottage.&nbsp; Now, as the noise of her
employment prevented our hearing each other, she was obliged to
leave off; but, that the interval of a few moments from labour
might not pass unproductively, she caught up her knitting needles
at the same <a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>instant, and advanced the fabric of a stocking while she
gave us our directions.&nbsp; Such instances of persevering
industry were frequent throughout the principality; but more
particularly so from hence westward, where not a female was to be
seen unemployed in knitting, however she might be otherwise at
work, in carrying loads or driving cattle.</p>
<p>Llanelly is a small irregular town, and contains an old seat
of Sir John Stepney&rsquo;s, which, though deserted by the
family, afforded habitation to numerous tenants, till the
mischievous operation of the window-tax, in driving them out,
left it to moulder in decay.&nbsp; The high square embattled
tower of its church is remarkable, in being much wider at the
base than upwards, forming a sort of cone.&nbsp; This town,
however, offering no objects to detain us, we proceeded without
halting, and in a few miles ride gained the summit of Pembree
hill.</p>
<p>Here a marine view of great extent burst upon us; the grand
sweep of Caermarthen bay appeared beneath, terminated on one side
by Wormshead point, and on the other by the insulated rock of
Caldy in Pembrokeshire; the opposite shores of Somerset and <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>Devon formed
the distance, faintly skirting the horizon beyond a vast expanse
of sea, studded with numerous vessels.&nbsp; Looking internally,
the country exhibited a strong undulatory surface, variously
chequered with wild heaths and rich cultivation.&nbsp; Descending
the hill, we approached the neat regular-built town of new <span
class="smcap">Kidwelly</span>, situated in a narrow well-wooded
valley.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p34b.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>The castle forms a noble object, adjoining the ruins of old
Kidwelly on the opposite bank of the river.&nbsp; Leland says,
&ldquo;the old town is prettily waullid, and hath hard by the
waul a Castel; the old town is nearly al desolated but the cartel
is meately well kept up.&rdquo;&nbsp; This description applies
very well to the present appearance of the place; for, though the
castle is uninhabited, it continues tolerably entire.&nbsp; This
fortress was built soon after the Conquest, by Maurice de
Londres, one of the twelve Norman knights who conquered
Glamorganshire; and, after undergoing the usual vicissitudes of
sieges, partial demolition, and different masters, fell to the
crown of England.&nbsp; We were disappointed of an internal
examination of this fine ruin, as the key of the entrance could
not readily <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>be obtained, and we were pressed for time to reach
Caermarthen before dark.&nbsp; The continuance of our route led
us on a steep woody bank, above the romantic course of Kidwelly
river; but it soon deviated to the superior attractions of the
Towey; following whose expansive water and verdant
accompaniments, and crossing a long antique bridge, we reached
Caermarthen.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">CAERMARTHEN&mdash;FEMALE
LABOURERS&mdash;LLANSTEPHAN CASTLE&mdash;A FORD&mdash;LAUGHARNE
CASTLE&mdash;FINE MARINE VIEWS&mdash;NEW INN&mdash;TENBY.</p>
<p>The situation of Caermarthen, one of the most wealthy and
polite towns in Wales, can scarcely be enough admired; rising
above a noble river, and commanding a full view of one of the
most beautiful vales in the kingdom.&nbsp; Internally, there is
less to commend; as most of the streets are very steep, and
irregularly built; yet there are many good private houses,
belonging to the neighbouring gentry that resort here in the
winter months; and a handsome town-hall and some other buildings
do credit to the public spirit of the town, though a solitary
church may reflect but little on its sanctity.&nbsp; Very small
remains of the castle, now built up into a gaol, appear; or of
the walls that formerly encompassed <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>the town.&nbsp; The trade of the
place is much facilitated by its fine river, which conveys ships
of a good size up to the bridge.</p>
<p>Caermarthen is the Kaervyrdhin of the Britons, the Maridunum
of Ptolemy, and the Muridunum of Antoninus.&nbsp; The ancient
Britons reckoned it the capital of all Wales: here they held
their Parliaments, or Assemblies of wise men, and here fixed
their Chancery and Exchequer.&nbsp; When the Normans overran
Wales, this town severely felt the miseries of war, being often
besieged, and twice burnt by the Welch princes; Gilbert Earl of
Clare, however, at length fixed his power at Caermarthen beyond
the reach of their attempts.&nbsp; This place gave birth to the
famous Merlin in the year 480: he appears to have been a man of
extraordinary wisdom and learning, which, no doubt, occasioned
him to be looked upon as a magician in that dark age, and
transmitted as such to posterity by Monkish writers, who always
looked with an evil eye upon knowledge possessed out of their
craft.&nbsp; Here also was born Lewis Bayly, chaplain to James
the First, afterwards Bishop of Bangor, and author of the
celebrated &ldquo;Practice of Piety.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>From
our comfortable quarters at the Green Dragon, we set out early in
the morning; and, on leaving the town, were more interested than
pleased, in noticing several fine young women who were acting as
scavengers, while one, whose elegance of form defied even her
awkward habit to conceal it, was bending beneath the fatigue of
wheeling away the filth in a barrow.&nbsp; In the same point of
view, seated behind a counter, a brawny-fisted fellow was folding
up ribbons and laces.&nbsp; How odious is the employ of
men-milliners!&nbsp; How shameful, that men, who might gain a
prosperous livelihood in a thousand ways, should interfere with
almost the only eligible means which the limited powers and
habits of women capacitate them to adopt for a maintenance!&nbsp;
Driven from their natural employ, they must either have recourse
to a cruel drudgery which they were not formed, and are generally
unable, to endure; or wander after subsistence in the paths of
shame and misery, at once a disgrace, a burthen, and a terror to
society.&nbsp; But does our censure more properly fall on these
men, for entering into the pretty dalliance of women&rsquo;s
affairs, in preference to masculine pursuits requiring
intellectual and <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>bodily exertion? or on the ladies, who encourage men,
rather than their own sex, in the fiddle-faddle arrangement of
their caps and tuckers?</p>
<p>Passing this group, we soon left the high road, and struck off
into a narrow imbowered lane, up a laborious ascent, toward
Llanstephan Castle.&nbsp; On arriving at the top of the hill, we
were amply repaid for our toil by a most enchanting view over the
Vale of the Towey: a stripe of the richest verdure, intersected
with numerous hedgerows and ornamental plantations, arose on each
side of the river; above which, a parallel range of high-wooded
and cultivated hills formed the boundary of the valley.&nbsp; The
extensive town of Caermarthen; the lofty spire of its church; the
ruined castle, and the long old bridge, with several barks lying
near it; were conspicuous objects at a short distance in the
picture; which was considerably enlivened by several
gentlemen&rsquo;s seats, and their appendant decorations.&nbsp;
The town of Abergwilly, on the banks of the river, with the
bishop of St. David&rsquo;s palace, an ordinary building, would
also have appeared in the distance; but the termination of the
valley was denied us, by <a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>the morning mist not having cleared
away.&nbsp; Pursuing our route, we took every opportunity that
intervals in the hedge afforded, of renewing our treat, and
discovered new beauties at each succeeding station.</p>
<p>At length we parted with this agreeable scenery; and soon
after, on a sudden turn of the lane, came within view of the
picturesque ruin of Llanstephan castle.&nbsp; A farming party
also appeared at this instant, proceeding with goods for
Caermarthen market.&nbsp; This group was opened by a robust young
fellow driving a couple of cows; he wore the general dress of the
country, a short blue coarse cloth coat, and breeches of the same
open at the knees; but he also possessed the luxury of shoes and
stockings.&nbsp; A sledge loaded with sacks of grain followed;
drawn by a horse, on which a lusty wench sat astride, as the
peasant girls generally do in Wales; cloathed in a brown jirkin
and petticoat, but with her lower extremities uncovered.&nbsp;
She urged on the horse by kicking him with her bare heels, while
her hands were busied in knitting.&nbsp; Two other buxom
bare-legged girls followed on foot, with their fingers similarly
employed, and with large baskets of eggs and poultry on <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>their
heads.&nbsp; But a word on the sledge, the common farming
carriage in Wales.&mdash;This is a most simple contrivance,
consisting of two rude poles, between which the horse is placed;
their ends trail on the ground, toward which extremity there are
two or three cross bars; a few upright sticks from these complete
the carriage.&nbsp; A comely dame, seated on horse-back, and
accommodated with a sort of side-saddle made with cross rails,
was probably the mistress; she closed the rear; and her superior
condition was evident, in her dark blue worsted stockings,
ponderous shoes, and small brass buckles.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Llanstephan castle</span> crowns the
summit of a bold hill, whose precipitous base is washed by the
sea.&nbsp; Its broken walls inclose a large area; and, furnished
with several encircling earthen ramparts, appear to have
possessed considerable antique strength.&nbsp; From numerous
stations it offers a truly picturesque appearance; and in the
approach charmingly combines with the surrounding landscape;
which, ever varying, is sometimes confined to the woody
character; at others, exhibits the wide estuary, the rocky
promontory forming its opposite shore, and the boundless sea.</p>

</a></p>
<p><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>This
castle is said to have been built by the sons of Uchtred, prince
of Merionethshire, anno Domini 1138; but soon after fell into the
hands of the Normans and Flemings; in 1145 it was taken from them
by Cadelh, son of Rhys Prince of South Wales; and so vigorously
maintained, that the utmost force which the foreigners could
raise was unable to retake it.&nbsp; However, by the year 1189 it
must have been in the possession of the English, as Caradoc
informs us that it was then taken from them by Prince Rhys.</p>
<p>The village, a neat humble place, is snugly situated beneath
the &ldquo;Castle-cap&rsquo;d hill&rdquo; in a woody hollow;
whence we traversed a lofty ridge, commanding extensive views, to
a neighbouring estuary, formed by the Tave near its junction with
the sea.&nbsp; As the tide was out, we could not avail ourselves
of the ferry, but had ample directions where the water might be
crossed; yet, unfortunately, on arriving at the sands, the
description of circumstances received for our guidance proved so
general, that we were unable to select the route intended; and
the broad current ran with such threatening rapidity into the
sea, only half a mile distant, that it would have <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>been highly
dangerous to have ventured in upon hazard.&nbsp; Ignorant how to
proceed, and unwilling to return three or four miles for fresh
directions, we gladly observed a couple of young women trudging
on the sands in a direction toward us.&nbsp; The proper place for
fording was now pointed out, where, it was said, the water would
scarcely cover our horses&rsquo; knees; we deemed it most
prudent, however, to let the natives go first, and they
accordingly entered the river, using the precaution of raising
their drapery.&nbsp; We followed close; but the lasses had
considerably underrated the depth of the water, for it took both
them and our horses above their middles; yet so carefully were
their clothes held up, that not a thread was wetted.&nbsp; On
reaching the opposite shore, their petticoats were suffered to
descend: my friend and I then looked at each other, passed an
observation, returned our thanks to the damsels, wished them a
good morrow; and under an overhanging rock of red granite,
crowned with the ivy-mantled remains of <span
class="smcap">Laugharne castle</span>, reached the town, an
irregularly built little place, seated on a low bank of the
estuary.</p>
<p><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>Laugharne castle, though not very extensive, and not
generally striking for picturesque disposition, has a noble
aspect toward the town.&nbsp; The foundation of this Castle is
not transmitted to us in the Welch annals, but is, doubtless, of
high antiquity; it was occupied, and probably built, by the
Normans and Flemings on their conquest of these parts;
afterwards, in the year 1215, it was besieged and taken by
Llewelyn: Leland says, &ldquo;it longid some time to the Earl of
Northumberland.&rdquo;&nbsp; An interesting ride, upon a high
boundary of the sea, brought us into <span
class="smcap">Pembrokeshire</span>, at a place called New
Inn.</p>
<p>In this progress, extensive views ranging over the Bristol
channel were continual; but one <i>coup
d&rsquo;&oelig;il</i>,</p>
<blockquote><p>High from the summit of a craggy cliff<br />
Hung o&rsquo;er the deep&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>was eminently striking! magnificently beautiful!&nbsp; The
whole sweep of Caermarthen bay, with its several estuaries, high
cliffs, and swelling shores, appeared beneath us, extending in
one direction to the extreme point of Gower, and in the other to
the isle of Caldy in Pembrokeshire; at the latter termination,
the picturesque whitened town of Tenby, romantically <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>built on a
tongue of rock projecting into the sea, seemed issuing from the
waves.&nbsp; From the grand amphitheatre of this bay, the eye
roamed, over a vast tract of sea, to the shores of Somerset and
Devon, hear fifty miles distant, faintly penciled on the horizon,
and terminated by the advancing swell of Lundy Island.&nbsp;
Further westward, the setting sun appeared in conjunction with
the sea, there widening into the Atlantic Ocean; its golden
effulgence glittered in reflexion from the waves, and diffused
itself over the whole scenery: numerous barks in the bay, sailing
on different tacks, caught partial gleams of illumination; and a
large fleet of ships, entering the channel at a remote distance,
seemed little more than dusky spots on the glistening expanse:
the <i>tout ensemble</i> formed one of the most pleasing marine
pictures that I ever saw.&mdash;The sea, viewed under its
ordinary circumstances, from a <i>low</i> situation, engages
little interest; the angle of vision is then intersected by the
aqueous segment at the distance of four or five miles; and, with
little more breadth of water than one meets with in a river or
lake, the prospect finishes in a mere hard line.&nbsp; The case
is far otherwise <a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>when it is viewed from a high mountain, particularly if
that mountain be a bold promontory, and the view bursts upon the
spectator on a sudden: a world of waters then meets his
astonished sight; the immense object presses on his mind an
inconceivable emotion; and an image is at once stamped of the
genuine sublime.&nbsp; Filled with the vast idea, he contemplates
with awe and veneration the magnitude of his Creator&rsquo;s
works, and sinks into a proper estimate the puny achievements of
man.</p>
<p>From New Inn, a small collection of cottages on the beach,
with a large old mansion, lately modernized, but seemingly of the
foundation of Elizabeth&rsquo;s time, and where (it is to be
observed) there is no house of public entertainment, as the name
would imply, we passed, among numerous collieries belonging to
Lord Milford, towards <span class="smcap">Tenby</span>.&nbsp;
This town is curiously situated on the ridge of a narrow rock
projecting into the sea: a sandy tract connects it with the main
land; which being sometimes overflowed, the town becomes
insulated.&nbsp; The streets of Tenby are inconveniently steep;
yet its romantic situation, and commodious sands for bathing,
have <a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>lately rendered it a place of fashionable resort.&nbsp;
It has a number of good lodging-houses, with a respectable hotel;
and, when we were there, boasted an overflow of genteel
company.&nbsp; The quay was well lined with vessels, and the
whole carried with it an air of opulence.&nbsp; Here was formerly
an important fishery, but that concern is now much diminished;
yet the exportation of coals, has greatly increased, and that
article has become the staple commodity of the place.&nbsp; The
remains of Tenby castle (a Norman structure) are very
inconsiderable: the broken walls appear toward the extremity of
the cliff; and below them, I understand, there are some large
natural caverns.</p>

</a></p>
<p>On a tempestuous day, a day fraught with trouble and alarm, we
left Tenby, and took the Pembroke road traced on a ridge of
hills, which command extensive views over almost the whole of
Pembrokeshire, and a great part of the Bristol channel; but a
heavy atmosphere frowned on the scenery, and threatened a violent
storm.&nbsp; Leaving the high road, we descended toward the sea
coast in search of the gloomy remains of <span
class="smcap">Manorbeer castle</span>, and found the ruin wildly
situated as described by Leland, &ldquo;between two little
hillettes,&rdquo; whose rocky bases repelled the fury of an angry
sea.&nbsp; This fortress appears to have been of Norman erection;
it fell to <a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>the Crown in the reign of Henry the First; a grant from
James the First presented it to the Bowens of Trelogne; from them
it descended by marriage into the family of Picton Castle, and in
the year 1740 was the property of Sir Erasmus Philips,
Bart.&nbsp; The ponderous towers and massive fragments of this
castle denote its original strength and importance to have been
considerable; yet now, deprived of &ldquo;the pride, pomp, and
circumstance of glorious war,&rdquo; it exhibits a scene so wild
and desolate, as might disclaim all intercourse with man: rank
grass clothes every projection; &ldquo;the thistle shakes its
lonely head&rdquo; from the windows, the sea-bird screams through
the hall and adders creep where many a warrior stalked.&nbsp;
From our reverie over this gloomy relic of feudal despotism, we
were alarmed by a vivid flash of lightning; a loud clap of
thunder succeeded, which, reverberating through the ruin, had a
most impressive effect: the storm became violent, and seemed to
shake the mouldering battlements of the ruin; &ldquo;from their
hills the groaning oaks came down, the sea darkly tumbled beneath
the blast, and the roaring waves were climbing against our
rocks.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>A deluging rain now poured down, and drove us in search
of a shelter; the fragments of a spiral staircase offered a
descent to a subterraneous part of the castle, and we entered the
dark recess of a dungeon, whose mysterious gloom and earthy
exhalations might stir up fancy to create things worse</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Than fables yet have feign&rsquo;d, or fear
conceiv&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I thought I heard a voice; my friend thought so too: we
listened, but soon smiled at the conjecture; it was probably the
hoarse roar of the sea or &ldquo;eddying winds:&rdquo; but the
damp air of the dungeon threw a chill over us, that was even
worse than an exposure to the rain; and we were returning, when a
repetition of the noise that we heard before stopped us: we
listened, and distinctly heard more than one human voice; the
words were undistinguishable, but the tone severe and menacing;
all was again silent.&nbsp; My friend and I looked at each other,
but neither ventured to impart his thoughts.&nbsp; Conjecture,
however, did not remain idle.&nbsp; Was this a horde of those
barbarous men that we had heard of as inhabiting these coasts,
who, by setting up false lights, betray the unsuspecting mariners
<a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>on rocks
and shoals, and then plunder the wreck, often murdering the crew
who may attempt to defend their property?&nbsp; Or was it a gang
of smugglers? for such men were known to conceal their stores in
unfrequented ruins, and other wild seclusions.&nbsp; We were
inclined to favour this latter opinion; but derived little
satisfaction from it, on considering that they were scarcely
inferior to the former in ferocity; and that if they discovered
us, every thing was to be apprehended from a brutal policy, to
preserve the secret of their hidings place.</p>
<p>Our reflections were broken off by a further noise, and we
plainly heard a hoarse cautioning voice utter, &ldquo;Only you
mind, and we shall have &rsquo;em both.&rdquo;&nbsp; We again
appealed to each other&rsquo;s countenances, but no confidence
appeared in either; in silence, I threw out the tuck of my stick;
my friend drew a sword from his; for we were so far armed against
attack.&nbsp; Again all was hushed; and we ventured to raise
ourselves from the dungeon, in order to catch a glimpse of the
people with whom we had to deal; when a strong flash of lightning
illuminated the whole ruin; and from an aperture near its base;
we <a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>saw two
men emerge; the one armed with a gun, the other with a
spade:&mdash;I thought I had never seen two such
murderous-hooking fellows: we shrunk to our concealment
instinctively; yet not without an apprehension that we had been
seen.&nbsp; But our sensations may be easier imagined than
described, when within a few yards one of them was heard to say,
&ldquo;Why did you not bring your gun?&nbsp; I
shou&rsquo;dn&rsquo;t wonder if one got away:&rdquo; which was
answered by, &ldquo;Only you make sure of one, and I&rsquo;ll
engage to knock the other&rsquo;s brains out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now knowing the worst, we determined on sallying out; if
possible, to reach a little village that we had observed at no
great distance; or, if discovered, to endeavour upon closing in
with the gunsman before he could take aim!&nbsp; We sprang
forward together, and had nearly reached the great entrance when
the gun went off; and in the same moment I saw my friend extended
among the fragments of the ruin:&mdash;without stopping, I rushed
on toward the ruffian, hoping to use my stick with good effect
before the piece could be re-loaded; when, passing under the
portal, down the crevice where formerly the <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>portcullis
was suspended, a large fox darted and passed before me.&nbsp; A
loud voice now exclaimed, &ldquo;Dang it you&rsquo;ve missed
hur;&rdquo; and with no less joy than astonishment I beheld my
friend brandishing his sword behind me; we said nothing, but
pushed on together, and, suddenly turning an angle, met the
villains face to face.&nbsp; Again joy and astonishment struggled
for pre-eminence;&mdash;they recoiled from us, and, dropping
their weapons, with a loud yell darted out of sight!</p>
<p>Such dastardly conduct may appear irreconcilable with the
ferocious design of which we suspected them; but cowardice is no
stranger to cruelty; and the direct tenor of their expressions
forbade a rising suggestion that they intended us no harm.&nbsp;
Gathering up the gun and spade as trophies of our victory, and
remounting our horses, which remained as they were left, tied up
in a nook, we proceeded to the neighbouring village, or rather
two or three cottages.&nbsp; By the way I learned, that upon the
report of the gun, my friend fell in consequence of turning short
upon the slippery fragments of the ruin.&nbsp; On our approaching
the village, a number of <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>men, women, and children, appeared
crowding together with great eagerness; and we were no sooner
perceived, than an evident alarm pervaded the cluster, in which
was included the two ruffians.&nbsp; However, the peaceable
demeanour of the tourists, and the superiority of numbers on the
side of the natives, united in procuring a parley; when it
evidently appeared that a double misconception had taken place:
the men in whose countenances we had read the prognostics of
homicide, turned out to be two honest young farmers, who had
traced a couple of notorious robbers that had long infested the
neighbourhood (a brace of foxes) to their retreat in the castle
ruins.&nbsp; This account brought with it a new application of
the sentences that we had heard, and we were ashamed of our
misconstruction; but the men were not behindhand with us; for, as
they frankly declared, from our sudden appearance, they took us
either for ghosts or devils.&nbsp; The gun and spade were now
returned; and, instead of a deadly encounter, an exchange of good
wishes took place, on our leaving the villagers in the pursuit of
our journey.</p>
<p><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>By the
time we had reascended to the turnpike, the evening was closing
apace; and this circumstance, with the uncomfortable state of the
weather, made it a great object with us to take up our
night&rsquo;s quarters as soon as possible.&nbsp; Pembroke was
eight miles distant, Carew (called Carey) only two or three, as
we were informed by some country-people; we therefore struck off
into a bridle-road for the latter place, under their direction;
but soon found ourselves at a loss which to choose of three roads
that presented themselves; yet, seeing no one of whom we could
enquire, we were obliged to advance at hazard; and, after a long
ride through mire and loose stones, on meeting with a cottager,
were directed to return all the way back, and take a different
route.&nbsp; This vexatious task performed, we found ourselves
again at a loss, and again took a false route.&nbsp; We were now
completely enveloped in the darkness of night; the weather
continued stormy; and our craggy road hardly wore the
distinctness of a track.&nbsp; In this forlorn condition we
slowly paced on, not exclaiming like Ossian&rsquo;s chief,
&ldquo;Let clouds rest on the hills, spirits fly, and travellers
fear; <a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>let
the winds of the woods arise, the sounding storms descend; roar
streams, and windows flap, and green-winged meteors fly; rise the
pale moon from behind her hills, or inclose her head in clouds,
night is alike to me, blue, stormy, or gloomy the
sky.&rdquo;&nbsp; Alas! it made a sensible difference to us; but
at length a distant glimmering of light appeared between the
trees, which we gladly traced to a lonely cottage.&nbsp; Here, on
our calling out, a tall raw-boned man opened the door, and
discovered three others who were regaling round a blazing hearth:
these were all miners in a neighbouring coal-work.&nbsp; The
uniform black appearance of this group, their long matted, hair
half hiding their faces, which caught a ferocious turn from the
strong partial light of the fire, was not calculated to inspire
prepossession in their favour; but, though in the exterior
repulsive as their cheerless occupation, their hearts were not
estranged from sensations of benevolence; and yet, so little had
they of refinement, as to offer no complimentary condolence on
hearing of our difficulties; even yet more unfashionably by
actual services they relieved them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Masters,&rdquo;
<a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>said one
of the men, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll but step in a minute while I
finish my mess of porridge, I&rsquo;ll put you into the right
road; it can&rsquo;t be darker than it is; do sit down, and let
me put your horses in the cow-house; I suppose you
wou&rsquo;dn&rsquo;t like our fare (it was a mess of barley and
greens stewed with a bit of meat or bacon); but mother can give
you a drop of good mead, and some decentish bread and
butter.&rdquo;&nbsp; This invitation, with the manner in which it
was conveyed, offered a relief that neither of us was inclined to
reject; for, indeed, we had tasted nothing since breakfast, and
besides found that some barley might be had for our horses.&nbsp;
So seating ourselves in the chimney corner, we partook of the
refreshments brought us by an old withered matron, who finished a
scene forming a lively counterpart to that of the cavern in Gil
Blas.&nbsp; Our dame soon took a leading part in conversation;
she gratefully expatiated on the bounty of Providence in sending
us a plentiful year, and lamented the misery that prevailed last
winter, when, she declared, they were all starving, and many of
her neighbours died outright of hunger.&nbsp; This statement I
found general throughout <a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>the country.&nbsp; We left this
humble but hospitable roof with regret; nor was it without much
difficulty that we could prevail on our hostess to accept of a
trifling acknowledgement for her favours.</p>
<p>We again set forward through mire and darkness, conducted by
one of the men, who beguiled the time with stories of ghosts that
had been seen at Manorbeer castle.&nbsp; At length it became
somewhat lighter, and we parted with our friendly guide upon his
shewing us the strait road to <span
class="smcap">Carew</span>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Cold and
comfortless,&rdquo; we knocked at the inn door (for inn is the
name of every alehouse in Wales); when, to put a finishing stroke
to the troubles of this eventful day, we learned that they had
neither beds for us nor stabling for our horses; but we had
previously heard, that the village boasted two inns, and
accordingly went to the other: a similar information, however,
awaited us here; with the additional intelligence, that there was
not a stable in the village, and only one spare bed, which was at
the other alehouse; there was no alternative; we were constrained
to turn our tired and hungry horses into a field, and go back to
the first house.</p>
<p><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>Here
our apartment served not only &ldquo;for parlour and kitchen and
hall,&rdquo; but likewise for bed-room: every thing was in
unison, the discoloured state of the walls and furniture; the
care-worn looks of our host and hostess; our scanty fare,
consisting of hard barley bread and salt butter; with nauseating
ale, that even our keen appetites rejected; all betokened poverty
and wretchedness: while in the bed, which extended from one side
of the room to the other, two children were sending forth the
most discordant yells; the one suffering a violent toothache, and
the other crying because its brother cried.&nbsp; After enduring
this scene of purgatory upwards of an hour, we were shewn to our
bed: it was a recess built in an adjoining room, and furnished
with a bag of straw, which was kept in its place by a couple of
boards crossing the niche.&nbsp; In the same room was another
bed, where two more pledges of our landlord&rsquo;s tender
passion continued to torment us.&nbsp; Vexed with accumulating
plagues, we threw ourselves half undressed on the bed; but our
evil destiny had yet more troubles in store;&mdash;the sheets
were wringing wet; so that we had reason to expect <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>that on the
morrow we should be laid up with colds or fevers; but this
apprehension was soon superseded; for a legion of fleas attacked
us at all points with such persevering ferocity, that we were
kept in motion the whole night; a number of rats also, by
gamboling among our straw, while others were busy in grating a
sally port through the partition, held us in the fidgets; and
thus the danger of obstructed circulation was avoided.&nbsp; We
had just left off cursing rustic accommodation, and the itch for
travelling which had led us to these sufferings, when the door
opened; no light appeared, but the sound of footsteps, softly
treading, passed near us.&nbsp; Suspecting foul play, we
instantly sprang up, and caught hold of a poor ragged girl, who
acted as maid of the inn, and was going to sleep with the
children in the other bed.</p>
<p>This kind of rural accommodation may appear very diverting in
a narrative; but to those accustomed to better fare, it will be
found a very serious evil.&nbsp; Indeed, from this specimen we
afterwards made it a rule to finish our day&rsquo;s journey at a
good town; in consequence of which salutary resolution, <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>except in one
or two instances, we were never without a comfortable
lodging.&nbsp; This caution is very practicable in South Wales,
as the most interesting part of the country is well furnished
with accommodation.</p>

</a></p>
<p>On issuing from our house of mortification, we were regaled
with a fine view of <span class="smcap">Carew castle</span>,
situated on a gentle swell above an arm of Milford-haven.&nbsp;
Its extensive remains shew it to have been rather a splendid
palace, than a mere fortress; and it evidently appears the work
of different ages.&nbsp; The North front, a portion-looking over
the river, is scarcely castellated, but exhibits the mode of
building in use about the time of Henry the Eighth.&nbsp; From
the level of this front, the windows, square and of grand
dimensions, project in large bows: internally, this part is
highly ornamented; and a chimney-piece with Corinthian columns
appears among the latest decorations of the structure.&nbsp; The
great hall, built in the ornamented Gothic style, though much
dilapidated, is still a noble relic of antique grandeur.&nbsp;
Other parts of the building are of more remote date, and most of
the walls are remarkably thick and of solid masonry: a
peculiarity to be noticed; as the <a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>Welch castles are chiefly constructed
of grout-work. <a name="citation62"></a><a href="#footnote62"
class="citation">[62]</a>&nbsp; The subterraneous dungeons are
remarkably extensive, and assimilate with the grandeur of the
general design.&nbsp; This castle was anciently a residence of
the Welch princes, and given by one of them (Rhys ap Theodore),
with extensive lands, as a marriage portion with his daughter, to
Gerald de Cario, an Anglo-Norman chieftain, and ancestor of the
last proprietor of the castle; who, according to the tradition of
the neighbourhood, died a hundred and seventy years ago; since
which time the castle has been left to decay.</p>
<p>Here many a lofty tower of once menacing aspect lies hid in a
leafy umbrage.&nbsp; The spacious hall, that in feudal ages
glittered baronial splendor, is now engrafted with ivy, or in
mouldering fragments lies an undistinguished heap with the common
earth: where once was attuned the sweet song of minstrelsy, is
now heard the hoarse note of the raven; no more the high-wrought
arras shakes mysteriously from the walls, but an unaffected
profusion of ivy mantles the forsaken apartments; beasts graze
where dark-plumed <a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>barons sat arrayed; and the hallowed chamber of
&ldquo;my lady bright&rdquo; is become the resort of bats and
screech-owls.</p>
<p>Here the enthusiast, while scanning Gothic halls and
&ldquo;cloud-cap&rsquo;d towers,&rdquo; may feel his mind
transported to the ages of chivalry, and image all the pageantry
of feudal shews!&nbsp; Or, in more humble mood, may look upon
their faded grandeur, and venerate a silent monitor of human
ostentation.</p>
<p>As we admired the picturesque beauty of this scene, or
indulged in the moral reflections to which it gave rise, we
forgot our inconveniences and fatigue, and cheerfully returned to
the inn.&nbsp; Our horses were in waiting: poor animals! they had
no intellectual set-off to solid ill fare that they met with;
but, unrid of the previous day&rsquo;s mire, proceeded with us on
the road to Pembroke.&nbsp; On leaving the village, we observed a
Gothic cross on the side of the road, about twelve or fourteen
feet high, and apparently formed of a single stone: it was carved
all over with knots and scrolls, but we did not stop to examine
it minutely.&nbsp; On ascending a hill, we had a grand view of
the castle: indeed, it is from the south and south-west alone
that its <a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>important dimensions fully appear: hence also we saw the
elevated mansion of <span class="smcap">Lawrenny</span>, seated
on a lofty bank of an arm of Milford-haven, and beautifully
accompanied with wood and lawn.&nbsp; This place, particularly
excelling in natural beauties, is considered as one of the first
seats in Pembrokeshire; and we understood that it had received
much improvement from the taste and liberality of Mr. Barlow, the
present proprietor.&nbsp; A ride on an elevated ridge, which but
for the morning mists would have commanded extensive views,
brought us to Pembroke.</p>
<p>The town of <span class="smcap">Pembroke</span> principally
consists of one wide street built along the ridge of a hill
(washed by an arm of Milford-haven), and terminated at one
extremity by its castle.&nbsp; Although of late declining in
commercial importance, the aspect of the town is neat and
genteel.&nbsp; Leland says of this town in his time, &ldquo;it is
welle wauled and hath iii gates, est, west, and north; of the
wich the est gate is fairest and strongest, having afore hit a
compasid tour, not rofid; in the entering where of is a
Portcalys, <i>ex solido ferro</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of these
erections there are now but very imperfect remains; we observed,
however, <a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>that the north gate was still in tolerable repair.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pembroke castle</span> is a noble ruin,
seated on a cliff above the river.&nbsp; Caradoc of Llancaroon
says, that it was founded by Arnulph, son to the Earl of
Shrewsbury, anno 1094; but Giraldus Cambrensis fixes the time of
its erection in the reign of Henry the First, and the rounded
arches that occur in the building determine its foundation not to
have been later than that prince&rsquo;s reign.&nbsp; The most
remarkable features of this ruin are, the grand entrance, which
is still entire; and the juliet, or high round tower, the antient
citadel, which has still the &ldquo;Rofe of stone almost in
conum; the top whereof is covered with a flat mille stone;&rdquo;
as described by Leland.&nbsp; The walls of this tower are
fourteen feet in thickness; its diameter within is twenty-five
feet, and its height to the top of the dome seventy-five feet:
from mortices in the walls, this tower appears to have been
divided into four floors.&nbsp; The ruined chapel also is a
conspicuous object viewed externally;&mdash;and immediately
underneath it, in the body of the rock, is the Wogan, a grand
cavern deemed natural: if it be so, however, Nature has taken
more <a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>pains
in turning it correctly circular, and raising its elevated roof,
than she generally is found to have done in works of this
kind.&nbsp; Its diameter is fifty-three feet; and just within the
entrance we observed a spiral staircase which led through the
rock to the chapel within the castle.&nbsp; From the foundations
of an outwork, which we traced among shrubs and brambles on the
margin of the river, opposite the cavern&rsquo;s mouth, it
appears to have been less a place of concealment than an avowed
sally-port, or regular entrance from the river.&nbsp; The castle
is remarkable in history for having been the birth-place of Henry
the Seventh; and also for the gallant defence that it made for
Charles the First.</p>
<p>About two miles from Pembroke, near the road to Tenby, is
<span class="smcap">Lamphey Court</span>, an episcopal palace
belonging to the see of St. David&rsquo;s; and, after the
alienation, a residence of Lord Essex&rsquo;s, the favourite of
Elizabeth.&nbsp; This dilapidated structure is chiefly remarkable
for a light parapet, raised on arches encircling the building,
similar to the one noticed at Swansea.&nbsp; From Pembroke, a
road extends southward through an uninteresting district to <span
class="smcap">Stackpoole court</span>, the seat of <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>Lord Cawdor,
situated in a deep romantic valley near the sea-coast.&nbsp; The
mansion is worthy of its noble owner; and the finely-wooded park
and grounds exhibit a more luxuriant verdure than might be
expected so near a sea-beat promontory.&nbsp; A short distance
westward, upon the coast, is St. Govin&rsquo;s chapel; and near
it, a well of the same name, thought by the country people to be
miraculous in the cure of several disorders.&nbsp; We have since
regretted our not visiting the sea-cliffs in this neighbourhood,
which we are told assume a very grand and romantic
appearance.&nbsp; In the same neighbourhood we find described
<span class="smcap">Bosherston-meer</span>, &ldquo;a pool of
water so deep that it could never be sounded; yet before a storm
it is said to bubble, foam, and make a noise so loud as to be
heard at several miles distance.&nbsp; The banks are of no great
circumference at the top, but broader downwards, and at a
considerable depth is a great breach towards the sea, which is
about a furlong distant, and is supposed to have a subterraneous
communication with it.&rdquo; <a name="citation67"></a><a

<p class="gutsumm">LITTLE ENGLAND BEYOND
WALES&mdash;MILFORD-HAVEN&mdash;WELCH
BEAUTIES&mdash;HAVERFORDWEST FAIR&mdash;THE TOWN, CASTLE, AND
PRIORY&mdash;PICTON CASTLE&mdash;HUBBERSTON&mdash;MILFORD.</p>
<p>In the reign of Henry the First, a colony of Flemings, driven
from their country by an inundation, were permitted to settle in
the western neighbourhood of Milford-haven.&nbsp; These were
often attacked by the Welch, but unsuccessfully: they soon
extended their territory over a great part of the county, and, in
conjunction with the Normans, carried their arms as far as
Llanstephan.&nbsp; Camden calls this district, &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Little England</span> beyond Wales;&rdquo; and the
difference of appearance, customs, and language, between the
inhabitants of southern Pembrokeshire and their neighbours, is
strikingly obvious at the present day.&nbsp; The tourist in
Caermarthenshire <a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>will scarcely meet a peasant who speaks a word of
English; but in an hour&rsquo;s ride, towards Pembroke, he will
find it universally spoken.&nbsp; I remarked this to mine host at
Carew; who exultingly assured me, that Pembrokeshire was out of
Wales; that he (a native of the place) was an Englishman; and
that for his part he did not understand any thing of the Welch
gibberish.</p>
<p>The men, tall and well made, evidently incline more to the
English character than the Welch; yet they possess some personal
traits distinct from either: I imagined, indeed, in many of the
peasantry a resemblance to the present inhabitants of
Flanders.&nbsp; Although this corner of the principality is the
most remote from England, it is the most civilized.&nbsp; This
may be accounted for, from the commercial habits brought over by
the Flemings (which still continue) introducing the manners of
other nations; an advantage denied to the generality of the
Welch, whose ancient (perhaps wholesome) prejudices disinclined
them to extensive commerce.</p>
<p>We took our final departure from Pembroke, on the road to
Haverfordwest, not <a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>without often looking back on the princely relics of its
castle, towering above the river: but, crossing a ridgy eminence,
our attention was diverted by the appearance of <span
class="smcap">Milford-haven</span>.</p>
<p>This noble harbour, immortalized by the strains of our great
dramatic poet, is of an oblong figure; about ten miles in length,
and from one to two in width.&nbsp; It is justly considered as
the best and safest in Great Britain, and inferior to none in
Europe; abounding with the best anchorage, and having five bays,
ten creeks, and thirteen roads.&nbsp; Two forts that were erected
in the time of Elizabeth on the opposite points of the entrance,
called Nangle and Dale blockhouses, are now neglected.</p>
<p>As a picturesque object, Milford-haven is chiefly interesting
for its noble sheet of water: its peaceable shores, rising in
gentle hills, may please from their flowing outline; but,
uncloathed with wood, and unbroken into crags or precipices,
their sameness fails to interest an eye habituated to bolder
scenery.&nbsp; The mouth of the haven, turning suddenly
southward, gives it from most points of view the appearance of a
lake.&nbsp; It very strongly <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>reminded me of several of the lakes
in Cumberland; but, although its surface is greater; the lakes
far transcend it in the accompanyments of rock and wood, and a
sedgy margin that mixes its verdure with the water: whereas the
haven is surrounded by a broad stripe of mud, except at high
tide: this defect, however, is constituent to all estuaries and
tide rivers.&nbsp; More richly decorative in their scenery are
the three branches of Milford-haven, which diverge at the
extremity of the great bason, and distribute fertility and beauty
over the principal part of Pembrokeshire. <a
name="citation71"></a><a href="#footnote71"
class="citation">[71]</a>&nbsp; It was our intention to have
crossed these branches at Lawrenny and Landshipping, and to have
taken Picton castle and Slebatch in our way to Haverfordwest;
but, not having a whole day before us, considering the time due
to the several objects, and learning that the ferries were
uncertain, we recollected our sufferings at Carew, and by taking
the direct <a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>road to Haverford avoided the risk of being again
benighted. <a name="citation72"></a><a href="#footnote72"
class="citation">[72]</a></p>
<p>We were detained at the ferry near an hour; for the
embarkation and passage of three carriages and their horses from
the opposite side occupied all the boats during that time.&nbsp;
But, although restless enough ourselves, we were not the most
anxious part of a company that was waiting for a passage: several
young men and near twenty young women, all dressed in their
holiday-clothes, were panting for the amusements of Haverfordwest
fair: perhaps a description of these lasses may convey some idea
of Pembrokean beauty.</p>
<p>Health, contentment, and cheerfulness, combined, formed their
predominant expression: yet it might be truly said, in the words
of Gray,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;O&rsquo;er their warm cheeks and rising
bosoms move,<br />
The bloom of young Desire, and purple light of Love,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A roundish oval circumscribed their faces; their eyes, not
over large, of a dark blue, <a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>unstrained by the wakeful vigils of
fashionable revelry, displayed all the native brilliancy of those
interesting organs; their noses, though of the snub kind, were
well formed; and pretty pouting lips were ever ready to distend
into a smile, on which occasion rows of ivory appeared, such as
could hardly be matched out of Pembrokeshire. <a
name="citation73"></a><a href="#footnote73"
class="citation">[73]</a>&nbsp; The tendency to
<i>embonpoint</i>, so characteristic of the Welch woman, was by
no means displeasing in these young and elastic subjects;
whatever was lost in elegance, was compensated in another point
of view; their necks, of the most luxuriant prominence,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;With youth wild throbbing&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>were modestly handkerchiefed to their throats; yet did the
thin gauze covering, closely embracing the proud distensions of
nature, only the more bewitchingly manifest the beauties which it
was appointed to conceal.&nbsp; Their other proportions were in
unison, and, as a jockey, who was also going to the fair,
coarsely, <a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>but clearly, observed, &ldquo;full of hard
meat.&rdquo;&nbsp; In truth, among them, it were no difficult
matter to find what Homer would,
call&mdash;&#977;&alpha;&lambda;&epsilon;&rho;&#8130;&nu;
&pi;&alpha;&rho;&alpha;&kappa;&omicron;&iota;&tau;&iota;&nu;.&nbsp;
The dress of the Welch women, however, is not calculated to set
off their persons: a close mob cap has little grace, especially
when surmounted with a round felt hat; and their very long
waists, and brown or plaid cloth jackets and petticoats, but
render the rotundity of their foundations more
unpicturesque.&nbsp; It cannot at present be said, that:</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&ldquo;their
tender limbs<br />
Float in the loose simplicity of dress.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>yet, as the smart girls begin to imitate our English modes, in
the course of a few years every contour of nature may be as free
public inspection in Wales, as it is at present in the polite
circles of the metropolis.</p>
<p>Crossing the ferry, we left this interesting group; and, in
proceeding up a high bank of the haven, enjoyed a fine view of
its expansive surface, and grand undulating shores.&nbsp; About
half-way to Haverfordwest a new scene burst upon us, consisting
of a wide luxuriant valley, watered by a large arm of
Milford-haven.&nbsp; We were denied a distinct view of this scene
by a hazy atmosphere; but are informed <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>that it is uncommonly rich and
extensive in clear weather.&nbsp; On approaching the town of
Haverfordwest up a laborious ascent, we passed through the fair,
which is held just without the town.&nbsp; Black cattle and
horses were the chief objects of the meeting, which had scarcely
any diversions; no shews: nor any jugglers, except a recruiting
party, and two or three cattle jobbers, or middle men, who agreed
upon the price of the market, while the actual buyers and sellers
stood gaping at each other, in amazement how such prices could be
obtained!&nbsp; Perhaps they had to learn, that for an
<i>indispensable commodity</i>, exclusively held by a set of men
whose interests are common, <i>any</i> price may be
obtained!&nbsp; But we had some rural sports: a party of rustics
were dancing on the green, to the notes of a miserable scraper;
yet of him it could not be said,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Old Orpheus play&rsquo;d so well he
mov&rsquo;d old Nick;<br />
But thou mov&rsquo;st nothing but thy fiddle-stick,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>for the reeking brows of his company very plainly evinced the
laborious agitation that he had excited.&nbsp; Close by, a game
at see-saw seemed to create much diversion among the
bye-standers.&nbsp; We joined in the throng, and were <a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>entertained
with a good-natured dispute between a comely lad and as blythe a
lass as any the fair could boast: they were in the midst of their
acquaintance; and we learned from one of them, that on the
following Sunday they were to be married: he wished her to ride
with him at see-saw, and she persisted in refusing; he hauled her
to no purpose, until a sharp-looking little girl said, that if
she were in his place she would put off the wedding for a
fortnight, to be revenged; a loud laugh succeeded this, at the
expence of the bride-elect; but the allusion to matrimony forced
no downcast confusion on the lass; perhaps her rosy dimples were
painted with a deeper hue; yet the suffusion arose rather from a
glowing idea, than a sensation of unnecessary shame: wherefore
should she be ashamed of the approaching fulfilment of her
long-cherished wishes?&mdash;I do not know whether she feared
that her lover might adopt the advice of her mischievous friend,
or whether it was the natural compliance of the sex disqualifying
them for stout denial, that acted upon her; but she at length
yielded.&nbsp; Alas, poor damsel! she was not yet an adept at
see-saw; and a verification of Buxoma&rsquo;s <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>mischance was
witnessed by the whole Company:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Cuddy</i>.&mdash;Across the fallen oak
the plant I laid,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And myself
pois&rsquo;d against the tott&rsquo;ring maid.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; High
leap&rsquo;d the plank, adown Buxoma fell:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I
spy&rsquo;d&mdash;but faithful sweethearts never tell.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The town of <span class="smcap">Haverfordwest</span>
irregularly built on the steep bank of the river <span
class="smcap">Hia</span>, may now be considered as the capital of
Pembrokeshire; as well on account of its superior extent and
opulence, as from its having lately become the place of the grand
session.&nbsp; But the streets are narrow and dirty, and so steep
as to be seriously dangerous.&nbsp; A few good houses, among
which is a residence of the dowager lady Kensington, start up
here and there; but in such situations, as to convey no look of
importance to the place.&nbsp; However commerce may have diffused
wealth through this town, and proclaimed it the successful rival
of Pembroke; yet, compared with the clean, placid, and
respectable mien of the latter, it ensures no pre-eminence of
esteem from the tourist: it may, indeed, present to him the idea
of a purse-proud shop-keeper, strutting before a decayed
gentleman.</p>
<p><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>The
castle, seated on a cliff adjoining the town, is said to have
been built by Gilbert Earl of Clare, in the reign of King
Stephen, and was occupied by the Flemings.&nbsp; Though still
possessing considerable portions of its former importance, yet,
engrafted with modern additions to fit it for the county jail, it
has little picturesque attraction.&nbsp; A wall connected with
the castle, which once surrounded the town, is still in part
standing: a good quay, a custom house, a free school, a charity
school, and an alms house, are among the public concerns of this
town.&nbsp; Of three churches that it boasts, that of St. Mary is
a neat building; and its spire, covered with shingles and warped
from the perpendicular, has a curious effect.&nbsp; A short
distance southward of the town, near the river, are some remains
of a priory of Black cantons, founded by John de Haverford.</p>
<p>An excursion of three or four miles led us to <span
class="smcap">Picton castle</span>, the noble seat of lord
Milford, whose extensive domains cover a great part of the
surrounding country.&nbsp; This may be considered as one of the
most antique residences in the kingdom, having been built <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>by William de
Picton, a Norman knight, in the reign of William Rufus.&nbsp;
Upon his line&rsquo;s becoming extinct, it descended to the
Wogans, then to the Dones, and afterwards to the Philipses of
Kylsant; and during the Civil Wars, Sir Richard Philips made a
long and vigorous defence in it for King Charles.&nbsp; It is one
of the very few castles that escaped the dilapidations of
Cromwell, and is also remarkable for having been always
inhabited; yet the alterations and additions of successive
occupiers have not deprived it of its embattled figure.&nbsp; The
extensive and delightful plantations of this seat unite with
those of Slebatch, a handsome house built by the late Mr. Barlow,
and now in the possession of Mr. Philips.</p>
<p>In another excursion from Haverfordwest, passing Johnston, an
old seat of Lord Kensington&rsquo;s, to the obliging
communications of which nobleman I feel myself greatly indebted,
we reached <span class="smcap">Hubberston Haikin</span>, a
fishing town in Milford-haven, whence the Waterford packets
depart from Britain.&nbsp; This is a poor place, and ill-supplied
with accommodation for travellers; but at the still smaller <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>town of <span
class="smcap">Milford</span>, on the opposite side of the river,
we were informed, a good inn is established.&nbsp; Near
Hubberston are the small remains of a priory, consisting chiefly
of the gate-house; but of what foundation or order no legend
informs us.</p>

ISLAND&mdash;FISHGUARD&mdash;NEWPORT&mdash;KILGARRAN
CASTLE&mdash;SALMON LEAP&mdash;NEWCASTLE.</p>
<p>The choice of our journey from Haverfordwest <a
name="citation81"></a><a href="#footnote81"
class="citation">[81]</a> to Cardigan was a matter of some
difficulty; we were desirous of traversing the <a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>Precelly
Mountain, but could not think of leaving the ruins of St.
David&rsquo;s unexamined.&nbsp; At last we hit upon the expedient
of each taking a different road: my companion, having the better
horse, took the circuitous route by St. David&rsquo;s; and I, the
direct road over the mountains.</p>
<p>Proceeding upon this arrangement two of three miles, I halted
to take a retrospective view of the country.&nbsp; Haverfordwest
new wore a singular appearance, with its houses piled on each
other; but, accompanied by a fine river well furnished with
vessels, and by its bridge and massive castle, it presented an
agreeable picture.&nbsp; At some distance westward, the lofty
tower of Roche castle was conspicuous; and partly in the same
direction, the Trogan rocks, rising from the verdure in abrupt
crags, so as to be generally mistaken for stupendous ruins.&nbsp;
Turning to the east, within a short distance appeared an <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>ancient
encampment called <span class="smcap">St. Leonard&rsquo;s
rathe</span>, crowning a bold eminence; this work is circular,
and, from the height of its vallum and depth of its ditch, may be
attributed to the Saxons.</p>
<p>As I advanced from this spot I parted with the beauties of the
country: no objects of interest occurred; the unadorned views
became compressed in narrow limits, until at length they were
shut up in mountainous hollows.&nbsp; In this dreary track stands
a poor solitary house called New inn, half way between Haverford
and Cardigan: however, I here obtained part of a goose for my
dinner, and then proceeded up the <span class="smcap">Precelly
Mountain</span>.</p>
<p>This mountain, reckoned the highest in South Wales, is part of
a great ridge crossing Pembrokeshire in a direction East and
West.&nbsp; On gaining the summit, a prodigious extent of
prospect burst upon me.&nbsp; In front, a wild hilly tract, yet
not undiversified with patches of cultivation, stretched nearly
to the northern confines of South Wales, where the pale summit of
Plinlimmon, in Montgomeryshire, might be just distinguished from
the atmospheric blue: more westward, beyond a vast expanse <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>of sea, like
a doubtful mist rising from it, appeared Bardsey island, and the
neighbouring shores in Caernarvonshire; and looking across the
miserable country about Fishguard and St. David&rsquo;s, my guide
assured me, that &ldquo;on a very clear day a very good eye might
discover the mountains of Ireland;&rdquo; but, I confess, it was
not my good fortune to discover any such appearance.&nbsp; On
looking backward, the whole of the interesting country that I had
travelled in the neighbourhood of Milford-haven appeared in one
comprehensive though distant display.&nbsp; From dwelling a
considerable time on these extensive scenes, I traversed an
uninteresting country made up of lumpy hills, and left
Pembrokeshire in crossing the handsome old bridge of
Cardigan.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Cardigan</span> (in Welch chronicles
Abertivy <a name="citation84"></a><a href="#footnote84"
class="citation">[84]</a>) is a neat respectable town, though
many of its streets are narrow and steep, seated on the north
bank of the river Tivy, near its junction with the sea: the river
is navigable for ships of small burthen up to the quay, which
enables the inhabitants to carry on a pretty <a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>brisk trade
with Ireland.&nbsp; This town, though small, is governed by a
mayor, thirteen aldermen, and as many common councilmen.&nbsp;
The ruins of its castle, appearing on a low cliff at the foot of
the bridge, are very inconsiderable, scarcely showing more than
the fragments of two circular bastions overgrown with ivy; yet it
was once a large and important fortress.&nbsp; Its foundation is
ascribed to Gilbert de Clare, about the year 1160; but it was
soon after taken, and in part destroyed, by Rhys ap Gryffith. <a
name="citation85"></a><a href="#footnote85"
class="citation">[85]</a></p>
<p>Here are also the remains of a priory of Black monks, which
was dedicated to St. Mary, and was subordinate to the abbey of
Chertsey in Surrey.</p>
<p>Near Cardigan, in the year 1136, the English army, commanded
by Ranolph earl <a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>of Chester, was shamefully worsted, and the two barons
Robert Fitz Roger and Pain Fitz John, with 3000 others, slain on
the spot, besides a great number drowned by the fall of a
bridge.&nbsp; In this battle the English soldiers appeared to be
planet-struck, surrendering themselves prisoners to mere old
women; and the general with a few men made their escape not
without great difficulty.</p>

<img alt=
"St. Dogmael&rsquo;s Priory"

"St. Dogmael&rsquo;s Priory"
src="images/p86s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Early in the morning after my reaching Cardigan, I made an
excursion in search of <span class="smcap">St. Dogmael&rsquo;s
Priory</span>, about a mile and a half distant.&nbsp; This
fragment of antiquity is very much dilapidated, and boasts
scarcely any picturesque appearance; the few parts standing are
converted into barns, sheds, and habitations; but enough remains
to shew the original extent of the church; which was cruciform,
of no considerable dimensions, and of the early Gothic style; in
the cemetery adjoining the ruin, and the village church,</p>
<blockquote><p>&mdash;&ldquo;a church-yard yew,<br />
Decay&rsquo;d and worn with age,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>has a pleasing characteristic effect: and here the scene,
finely interspersed with wood, and overlooking the Tivy, is
undoubtedly picturesque.&nbsp; This priory was founded for
Benedictine <a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>monks by Martin de Turribus, a Norman chieftain, who
first conquered the surrounding territory called Kames or Kemish,
and deluged it with the blood of its natives.&nbsp; This was a
common trick for cheating the devil, practised by the organized
plunderers of that day.&nbsp; After pillaging a country, and
enslaving or massacreing the legitimate proprietors, they hoped
to expiate their crime, and quell the rising qualms of
conscience, by appropriating a part of their booty to a monkish
foundation&mdash;to a set of idle jugglers, scarcely less
inimical to the rights of society, though less ferocious, than
themselves.</p>
<p>Returning to the inn, I rejoined my fellow-tourist, who had
just completed his circuit of between forty and fifty miles round
the coast: of this route I learn the following particulars:</p>
<p>From Haverfordwest the road passes neat the elevated ruin of
Roche castle; thence extends through a wild dreary country, near
St. Bride&rsquo;s dangerous bay, and crossed the romantic creek
of Solva to the once flourishing city of <span class="smcap">St.
David&rsquo;s</span>, now in appearance an inconsiderable
village.&nbsp; This deserted place <a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>occupies a gentle eminence on that
projecting rocky cape called St. David&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; In a
sheltered hollow beneath the town, are the noble ruins of the
Metropolitan episcopacy of Wales; yet the <span
class="smcap">Cathedral of St. David&rsquo;s</span>, though long
a mouldering pile, having lately undergone a thorough repair,
with a just attention to the antique style of architecture, now
appears in renewed magnificence.&nbsp; This venerable structure
is cruciform, of large dimensions, and of the early Gothic
architecture, though not without much of the high-wrought
fret-work additions of later ages.&nbsp; The nave alone wears all
the simplicity of its original construction; the tower, highly
ornamented, rises from the middle of the church to the height of
127 feet; Bishop Vaughan&rsquo;s chapel behind the choir, and the
dilapidated one of St. Mary&rsquo;s, exhibit all the elegant
tracery of the ornamented Gothic; as does also the chapter-house,
and St. Mary&rsquo;s hall, now a ruin.&nbsp; Among the numerous
ancient monuments that are to be met with in the church and its
chapels, those of Owen Tudor, and Edward Earl of Richmond, father
of Henry the VIIth, both situated near the middle of the choir,
are worthy of notice.</p>
<p><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>The
episcopal palace is a superb ruin, surmounted with a light
parapet raised upon arches, in the style of Swansea castle and
Lamphey court.&nbsp; &ldquo;The area of the great court is 120
feet square; on the east side of which is the Bishop&rsquo;s
hall, 58 feet in length, and 23 in breadth; the King&rsquo;s
hall, on the south side, is 88 feet by 80.&nbsp; This grand
saloon is said to have been built expressly for the reception of
King John, on his return from Ireland in 1211.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
we are informed by Godwin, that the palace itself was not erected
until about the year 1335: which must be an anachronism, unless
the story of King John be unfounded.&nbsp; The first hall is a
grand room; but the latter has been particularly splendid.&nbsp;
Over the fine arched entrance are the statues of King John and
his queen; and at the cast end is a curious circular window with
bars diverging from the centre, still in a perfect
condition.&nbsp; The chapel containing the remains of a font, and
kitchen amply furnished with four chimneys, are also entire: nor
are the forsaken apartments deficient in proofs of the regal
splendor assumed by the Romish pastors of Christian humility.</p>
<p><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>Many
ruinous buildings, once habitations of ecclesiastical
functionaries, surround the cathedral; yet sufficient are kept in
repair for the diminished number of officers now appointed: the
cathedral service is, nevertheless, performed with an attention
that would do credit to more eminent establishments.&nbsp; The
whole of these buildings are inclosed by a wall eleven hundred
yards in circumference.</p>
<p>St. David&rsquo;s is supposed to have been a Roman station,
the Octapitarum of Ptolemy; and here St. Patrick is said to have
founded a monastery to the honour of St. Andrew in the year 470:
to this place St. David translated the archbishopric of Wales,
from Caerleon, about the year 577, and founded the cathedral,
which was afterwards dedicated to him; but the primacy was
withdrawn, and annexed to that of Canterbury, in the reign of
Henry the First.&nbsp; Here also a college was founded for a
master and seven priests by John Duke of Lancaster, in
conjunction with his wife and the Bishop of the diocese, in the
year 1369.</p>
<p>At the extremity of St. David&rsquo;s promontory is a
disjointed craig; so large, that it is supposed a hundred oxen
could not drag it away; <a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>but so placed on smaller stones, as
to have been easily rocked by the pressure of a man&rsquo;s hand.
<a name="citation91"></a><a href="#footnote91"
class="citation">[91]</a></p>
<p>In druidical ages, this formed the grand ordeal: if a man was
to appear guilty, the priests managed that he should apply his
pressure near the axis, and the stone remained immoveable; but if
his peace or priest offerings were deemed commensurate to his
sins, he was instructed to lean near the extremity, and it easily
gave way.&nbsp; Near this head-land is Ramsay island, a fruitful
little spot, and once particularly so in holiness, if we may
credit ancient histories, which state that no less than twenty
thousand saints lie interred in it.&nbsp; The dangerous rocks
called the Bishop and his Clerks, near this island, are covered
with wild fowl in the breeding season.</p>
<p>The road continues on a barren tempestuous waste to Fishguard,
a miserable fishing town, only remarkable for the late descent of
1400 French invaders, who, after a few days possession of the
neighbourhood, surrendered to the Welch peasantry, headed by Lord
Cawdor.&nbsp; Newport, a few miles farther, is <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>another poor
fishing town, at the bottom of a small bay: the ruined castle,
seated on a hill above the town, was built by the Anglo-norman
settlers in 1215, but afterwards nearly destroyed by
Llewellyn.&nbsp; In Nevern churchyard, near Newport, is the shaft
of a stone cross about thirteen feet high, curiously carved all
over with scrolls and knots.&nbsp; At Pentere Evau, in Nevern
parish, is a circle of rude stones, 150 feet in circumference; in
the midst whereof is a cromlech <a name="citation92"></a><a
href="#footnote92" class="citation">[92]</a> of great dimensions:
in the same parish is another altar monument, called
Llech-y-drybedh, having a furrow in the flat stone, which might
be to carry off the blood of the victims.&nbsp; In Grose&rsquo;s
Antiquities, five stone altars are stated to be in this
neighbourhood, and also four barrows; one of which, on being
opened, was found to contain five urns full of burnt bones.&nbsp;
Nothing worthy of particular notice occurs from this spat to
Cardigan.</p>
<p>We projected an aquatic excursion, to explore the scenery of
the Tivy; but, the tide not answering, we were obliged to desert
the river for two or three miles, and proceed by <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>land to
Kilgarran.&nbsp; The Tivy above Cardigan becomes environed by
high hills, whose approaching bases contract the bed of the
river, changing its character from a broad and majestic, to an
impetuous eddying stream: the sides of these hills rise from the
water in almost perpendicular steepness, yet clothed with trees
from the river&rsquo;s brink to their ridgy summits.&nbsp; In the
midst of this imbowered glen, a naked rock, crowned with the
truly picturesque remains of Kilgarran castle, proudly advances,
and forms a striking contrast to the dark rich verdure that
prevails in the other accompanyments of the river.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p93b.jpg">
<img alt=
"Kilgarran Castle"
title=
"Kilgarran Castle"
src="images/p93s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The position of Kilgarran castle is nearly on all sides
self-defended; but on the isthmus that connects the projecting
rock with the main land, two ponderous round towers seem to have
formerly defied the assault of war, as they now do that of
pilfering dilapidation.&nbsp; The broken walls, watch-towers, and
apartments that compose the minor parts of this fortress, bespeak
it to have been of no great original extent, or highly
ornamented; yet the scattered relics, variously interwoven with
ivy, offer an appearance from most points of view highly imposing
and grand.</p>
<p><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>The
foundation of the castle is uncertain, and the styles of
different ages appear throughout the building.&nbsp; According to
Carradoc, this fortress was erected about the year 1222, when
Marshall Earl of Striquil (Chepstow) vanquished the Welch under
their Prince Gruffydth, and gained an undisputed footing in these
parts.&nbsp; The town of Kilgarran is diminished into one street,
thinly inhabited by labouring farmers and fishermen.</p>
<p>In a romantic hollow, a mile or two higher up, the Tivy,
throwing itself over a ledge of rock in one bold sheet, though
not more than six feet in depth, forms a salmon leap generally
esteemed the most remarkable in Wales.&nbsp; The salmon, in its
course up the river, meeting with the fall, coils itself into a
circle, and by a sudden distension springs up the precipice, and
cleaves the torrent with astonishing vigour; <a
name="citation94"></a><a href="#footnote94"
class="citation">[94]</a> yet it is frequently baffled, and
greatly amuses the spectator with its repeated attempts to
overleap the cataract.&nbsp; We were not entertained with this
display of strength and agility on our visit, but were much
interested by the curious means employed <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>in catching
the fish.&nbsp; The fisherman is seated in a sort of canoe,
called a coracle, formed of open basket-work of thin laths,
covered with a horse&rsquo;s hide, or a well-pitched piece of
sail-cloth: the vessel is of a figure nearly oval, about four
feet and a half long and three wide, yet so light as to be
carried with ease on the man&rsquo;s shoulder from his home to
the river: in this he whirls among the eddies of the river; with
a paddle in one hand, he alters or accelerates his course with
surprizing dexterity; while with the other he manages the net,
the line being held between his teeth.&nbsp; In this way the
fishing in most of the rivers of Wales is pursued.&nbsp; Coracles
have been peculiar to British rivers from time immemorial.&nbsp;
Lucan very clearly describes them; and in latter times, Sir
Walter Raleigh relates, that &ldquo;the Britons had boats made of
willow twigs covered on the outside with hides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Near the water-fall is a manufacture of iron and tinned
plates, belonging to Sir Benjamin Hammet.&nbsp; Two or three
miles higher up the river is <span
class="smcap">Newcastle</span>, a small irregular town situated
upon its banks, and graced with the venerable ruins of a castle,
but of no great <a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>antiquity.&nbsp; Thence a road of twenty miles extends
through a dreary uninteresting country to Caermarthen.</p>
<p>A more romantic and sequestered path than is traced beside
&ldquo;the hollow stream that roars between the hills&rdquo; from
Lechryd bridge to Llangoedmor on the north margin of the river,
can scarcely be imagined; continuing upwards of two miles,
beneath the umbrage of its high and well-wooded banks, and
commanding delightful landscapes of the sombre kind at every
turn.&nbsp; In the parish of Llangoedmor, we learned, there were
several monuments of the druidical ages: one is a remarkably
large cromlech; the flat stone being eight or nine yards in
circumference, with one edge resting on the ground: there is a
smaller monument of the same kind near it; also a circle of rude
stones about twelve yards round; and five beds of loose stones,
each about six feet over.&nbsp; Llechly gowress (the stone of a
giantess) in the parish of Neuodh, also near Cardigan, is another
very large cromlech; and near it is a parcel of large hewn stones
nineteen in number; which, it is said by the vulgar, cannot be
counted.</p>

class="gutsumm">LLANARTH&mdash;ABERAERON&mdash;LLANSANFRIED&mdash;LLANRHYSTID&mdash;AN
ENQUIRY INTO A STRANGE ASSERTED CUSTOM RELATING TO THE MODE OF
COURTSHIP IN WALES&mdash;LLANBADARNVAWR&mdash;ABERISTWYTH, AND
ITS CASTLE.</p>
<p>We left Cardigan on the road to Aberistwyth, and soon entered
upon the same dreary kind of country that we noticed in the north
and north-west of Pembrokeshire.&nbsp; At the poor village of
Blaneporth, on the left of the road, is a large circular area
encompassed by a moat, which is most probably the remains of a
British fortification.&nbsp; Castel-Yn-dalig, a mile or two
further, is a similar work, but much larger and less
distinct.&nbsp; <a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>Thence we began to ascend a tract of lofty hills
(leaving Penrhyn church on our left near the sea-shore <a
name="citation98"></a><a href="#footnote98"
class="citation">[98]</a>), and, gaining a considerable eminence,
enjoyed an uninterrupted view over the whole sweep of
Cardigan&rsquo;s extensive bay.&nbsp; This bay, from its southern
limit, Strumblehead near Fishguard, stretching northward, extends
a vast gulph into North Wales, and is at length terminated by
Bardsey island in Caernarvonshire: it often proves a shelter to
ships in the Irish trade, and contains several good
harbours.&nbsp; The effect of this extensive display from the
great elevations that we traversed was extremely striking;
stretching from beneath us to a remote horizon the sea, exhibited
a silvery surface of immense magnitude; while the shores
presented an endless variety of bold advancing promontories,
overhanging cliffs, and high swelling mountains wild and
desolate; yet <a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>here and there a stripe of green meadow appeared on a
favoured slope, and a few woody plantations disclosed themselves
through picturesque hollows.&nbsp; In the distant boundary of
Caernarvonshire, the projecting and receding hills about Pulhelly
bay were conspicuous; opposed to these, the superior magnitude of
Cader-Idris arrested the attention, towering among the craggy
summits of the Merionethshire mountains.&nbsp; From the bay our
view roamed over a dreary uninteresting tract of country, to a
ridge of mountains, whose broken outline mixing with the clouds
defined the entrance of North-Wales; where, proudly rising above
competition, the confederated mountains, forming the pile of
&ldquo;Mighty Plinlimmon,&rdquo; appear in all their majesty.</p>
<p>The consideration of these distant objects, and the attention
demanded by a stumbling horse, were my chief employments from
Cardigan to Aberistwyth: yet the general tediousness of our ride,
upon a rocky track here called a turnpike, had some relief as we
passed through <span class="smcap">Llanarth</span>, a
<i>market-town</i>, consisting of half a dozen huts seated in a
romantic hollow; and <span class="smcap">Aberaeron</span>, about
<a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>four
miles further, a neat village near the seashore, pleasingly
situated at the entrance of an abrupt well-wooded valley.&nbsp;
Near its picturesque bridge there is a more comfortable inn than
might be expected in so retired a situation; and, as it
afterwards appeared, the only tolerable one between Cardigan and
Aberistwyth.&nbsp; From this place the road, bordering the
sea-shore, became more level; and we soon came within view of the
fragments of a castle on the beach, the greater part of which
appears to have been washed away by the action of the sea.&nbsp;
This fort was probably erected by the Normans to cover their
landing or retreat, when, in the reign of William Rufus, they
fitted out a fleet, and, descending on the coast of
Cardiganshire, conquered or ravaged the maritime country to a
considerable distance.&nbsp; Most of the principal towns then
fell into their hands, upon which they affected the government;
but, as a measure of no less necessity than policy, assigned
their power to Kadugan ap Bledin, a British chief of high
authority, who strictly adhered to their interest.&nbsp; His son
Owen however, rashly attacking the Normans and Flemings who had
lately settled in the neighbouring <a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>territory southward, was, with his
father, obliged to fly into Ireland.&nbsp; Henry the First then
entrusted the country to Gilbert Clare, who raised many
fortifications within the district.&nbsp; Kadugan and his son
Owen were nevertheless soon after restored to their lands; but
this son, committing fresh incursions, was slain by Gerald of
Pembroke, whose wife Nestra he had carried away.&nbsp; Old
Kadugan became a prisoner in England for a length of time, but
was in the end restored to his estates; when he was suddenly
stabbed by his nephew Madok.&nbsp; Henry the Second afterwards
gave this tract of country to Roger de Clare; whose son Richard
earl of Clare being slain in a contest with the Welch, Rhys,
prince of South-Wales, attacked and vanquished the Anglo-Normans
with great slaughter, and reduced them under his dominion.&nbsp;
But by degrees Cardigan returned to the hands of the English
until the final conquest of the country by Edward the First.</p>
<p>We soon after passed through the dreary village of <span
class="smcap">Llansansfried</span>, where a monastery is
conjectured to have existed; and about two miles further entered
<span class="smcap">Llanrhystid</span>, <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>which place
is assigned to be the site of another.</p>
<p>As we entered the latter village, &ldquo;the dark mists of
night&rdquo; fell over us.&nbsp; We therefore finished our
day&rsquo;s journey at the Red Lion inn, a tolerably decent
ale-house, where we were presently joined by a man in a
labourer&rsquo;s habit, whom we had observed on the road in very
gallant intercourse with a peasant girl, and had rallied on the
occasion; yet were we not a little surprized at finding him not
only a man of extensive information, but a classical scholar and
a well-bred gentleman.&nbsp; On his leaving the room, we had an
opportunity of enquiring who this character was, and learned from
our landlord that he was a native &rsquo;squire, who lived about
ten miles distant, who till lately had been in orders and
officiated in London; but on the death of his father had thrown
off the gown and become a man of pleasure.&nbsp; &ldquo;Though he
is so shabbily dressed,&rdquo; said our host, &ldquo;it is only a
frolic, for he is a very able man.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, as the term
<i>able</i> in Wales is synonymous with rich in other places, we
enquired the amount of his income, and found it to be <i>near a
hundred a year</i>.</p>
<p><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>This
gentleman proved a most agreeable and useful companion during the
evening; but we were sorry to observe in him a professed
Epicurean; the gratification of his appetites he declared to be
his great object, and defended his practice on what he termed the
fundamental principles of nature; nor was he in want of an
ingenious sophism against every point of attack.&nbsp; We
concluded that this gentleman&rsquo;s habits would qualify him
with due knowledge on a singular custom that is said to prevail
in Wales, relating to their mode of courtship; which is declared
to be carried on in bed; and, what is more extraordinary, it is
averred, that the moving tale of love is agitated in that
situation without endangering a breach in the
preliminaries.&nbsp; Mr. Pratt, in his &ldquo;Gleanings,&rdquo;
thus affirms himself an <i>eye-witness</i> of the process:
&ldquo;The servant-maid of the family I visited in
Caernarvonshire happened to be the object of a young peasant, who
walked eleven long miles every Sunday morning to favour his suit;
he usually arrived in time for morning&rsquo;s service, which he
constantly attended; after which he escorted his dulcinea home to
the house of her master, by whose permission <a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>they as
constantly passed the succeeding hours in bed, according to the
custom of the country.&nbsp; This tender intercourse continued
without any interruption near two years, when the treaty of
alliance was solemnized.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our companion, like every
one else that we spoke with in Wales on the subject, at once
denied the existence of this custom: that maids in many instates
admitted male bed-fellows, he did not doubt; but that the
procedure was sanctioned by <i>tolerated custom</i> he considered
a gross misrepresentation.&nbsp; Yet in Anglesea and some parts
of North Wales, where the original simplicity of manners and high
sense of chastity of the natives is retained, he admitted
<i>something of the kind</i> might appear.&nbsp; In those thinly
inhabited districts, a peasant often has several miles to walk
after the hours of labour, to visit his mistress; those who have
reciprocally entertained the <i>belle passion</i> will easily
imagine, that before the lovers grow tired of each other&rsquo;s
company the night will be far enough advanced; nor is it
surprizing, that a tender-hearted damsel should be disinclined to
turn her lover out over bogs and mountains until the dawn of
day.&nbsp; The fact is, <a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>that under such circumstances she
admits a <i>consors lecti</i>, but not <i>in nudatum
corpus</i>.&nbsp; In a lowly Welch hut, this bedding has not the
alarm of ceremony: from sitting or perhaps lying on the hearth,
they have only to shift their quarters to a heap of straw or fern
covered with two or three blankets in a neighbouring
cornet.&nbsp; The practice only takes place with <i>this view of
accommodation</i>.</p>
<p>At an early hour in the morning we left our &ldquo;flinty
couch&rdquo; at Llanrhystid; though rendered, by a day of
healthful fatigue, &ldquo;a thrice-driven bed of down;&rdquo;
and, skirting the sea, the resumed the views of the preceding
day.&nbsp; Advancing about two miles, we remarked, on a gentle
eminence in a field to the left of the road; several rough-hewn
stones patched over with the &ldquo;moss of the centuries:&rdquo;
two of these, remaining upright, are massive paralellopipeds,
from eight to ten feet high, standing within a yard or two of
each other; among the other stones lying about in different
directions, I could trace no indication of a circle; it has,
however, been supposed to be a Druidical temple; although the two
upright stones might rather seem to mark the &ldquo;narrow
house&rdquo; of some departed <a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>warrior.&nbsp; We soon after
descended into the abrupt vale of Ystwith, and crossed its river
over a picturesque bridge, venerably mantled with ivy. <a
name="citation106"></a><a href="#footnote106"
class="citation">[106]</a>&nbsp; Our route continued over the
high ridgy hills that divide the parallel vales of Ystwith and
Rhydol, the latter of which presented an agreeable contrast to
the dreary country through which we had travelled from within a
few miles of Haverfordwest.&mdash;Here, among extensive meadows
of the richest verdure, the meandering Rhydol wantons its
fantastic course.&nbsp; On a gentle eminence near its banks, in
the midst of the valley, appears the embowered town of <span
class="smcap">Llanbadarn-vawr</span>, a picturesque though
deserted spot, yet once a Roman city, and afterwards the seat of
an Episcopacy and Monastery established by St. Paternus in the
beginning of the sixth century.&nbsp; The church is yet a
handsome building.&nbsp; Between this town and the sea-coast is a
small ancient fortification, consisting of a square area
surrounded by a wall with a tower at one of the <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>angles.&nbsp; A range of wild hills, backed by the
stupendous Plinlimmon, forms the opposite boundary of this
valley; and at its termination in the sea-coast, the town of
Aberistwyth appears in a very picturesque light on the brink of
the sea, with its ruined castle on a gentle rise to the left.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Aberistwyth</span> is a less agreeable
town on entering it, than as a distant object.&nbsp; Most of the
streets are narrow and ill-paved; and the stone used being of a
black colour, gives the whole rather a dirty appearance; but this
remark is not applicable to some houses that have lately sprung
up for the genteel company which resorts to it in the
bathing-season.&nbsp; Nor must I mention the bathing at
Aberistwyth, without observing, that it is conducted with more
propriety than at any other watering-place that I have seen in
England or Wales.&nbsp; The ladies&rsquo; and gentlemen&rsquo;s
machines are placed nearly a quarter of a mile asunder; and the
indecency of promiscuous dipping, so disgusting at more
fashionable resorts, is in consequence avoided: the bathing too
is excellent, with a good sandy bottom at all hours of the
tide.</p>
<p><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>The
castle, seated on a craggy eminence projecting into the sea,
westward of the town, is so much dilapidated, as scarcely to
present a characterizing form: but there is an agreeable public
walk traced through the ruin, which commands a view of the sea
and the neighbouring coast; with the little port (common to the
Rhydol and Ystwith rivers) well filled with fishing vessels just
below the cliff.&nbsp; This spot is also enlivened by a tasteful
residence of Lady Juliana Penn&rsquo;s, lately erected near the
ruin, with much appropriate effect, in the form of a
gatehouse.&nbsp; Aberistwyth castle was founded by Gilbert de
Strongbow, son of Richard de Clare, in the reign of Henry the
First; but soon after its erection it fell into the hands of the
Welch princes, and was destroyed in their intestine
quarrels.&nbsp; Powell says, that the present castle was built by
Edward the First, anno 1277, a short time before the complete
conquest of Wales.&nbsp; It appears to have been a strong place,
as a garrison of King Charles maintained it for some time after
his death.</p>
<p>Among the mountains in the neighbourhood of Aberistwyth, a
number of lead and <a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>silver mines were discovered about three centuries
back; and in the reign of Elizabeth a company of Germans reaped a
great fortune in the enterprize of working them.&nbsp; Sir Hugh
Middleton, after them, was equally successful, netting
2000<i>l.</i> a month out of one silver mine.&nbsp; He was
succeeded by a Mr. Bushel, who also gained immense profit from
the works; insomuch that in the civil wars he made King Charles a
present of a regiment of horse, and clothed his whole army.&nbsp;
The company of mine-adventurers worked these mines also with
success, until they fell out among themselves, to their own
injury, and that of the mining interest throughout the country;
and I believe that these works have been deserted ever since.</p>

<p>We were detained at Aberistwyth by the continuance of a
violent rain which had deluged the neighbourhood for several
days.&nbsp; At length a cessation of the storm allowed us to
resume our journey, though not to perform a projected excursion
to the summit of Plinlimmon, which is only free from clouds in
very fair weather.&nbsp; Returning up the hilly confines of the
valley, we again admired the meandering Rhydol, and its gentle
accompanyment; but following its course, as we <a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>advanced
through a wild romantic district, the character of the valley
soon changed; dark wooded hills, aspiring to the dignity of
mountains, advanced their shagged sides toward the stream, and,
gradually closing to an impervious glen, shut up the river in
their recess.&nbsp; Beyond these hills rose the broken line of
mountains forming the termination of South Wales, where mighty
Plinlimmon, lord of the boundary, raised his stupendous head in
majestic desolation, though half concealed by eddying clouds: the
whole scene exhibited unfettered nature in her wildest
mood.&nbsp; A pouring rain that now fell over us circumscribed
our desert prospects, while we proceeded over uncultivated hills,
with scarcely a token of society, to the <span
class="smcap">Devil&rsquo;s Bridge</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p111b.jpg">
<img alt=
"The Devil&rsquo;s Bridge"

"The Devil&rsquo;s Bridge"
src="images/p111s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The cataract that is here formed by the falls of the Mynach
saluted us with its thundering roar, long ere we approached it;
but, as we drew near, the strong verberation, rebellowed by
surrounding cavernous rocks, seemed to convulse the
atmosphere!&nbsp; We hastily put up our horses at the Hafod arms,
a solitary inn; and in a few paces found ourselves on the bridge,
suspended over a gulph <a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>at which even recollection
shudders.&nbsp; This bridge bestrides a lane of almost
perpendicular rocks, patched with wood, whose summits are here
scarcely five yards asunder.&nbsp; At a terrific depth in the
glen rages unseen the impetuous Mynach, engulphed beneath
protruding craigs and pendant foliage: but on looking over the
parapet, the half-recoiling sight discovers the phrenzied
torrent, in one volume of foam, bursting into light, add
threatening, as it breaks against the opposing rocks, to tear the
mountains from their strong foundations; then, instantly darting
into the black abyss beneath, it leaves the imagination free to
all the terrors of concealed danger.&nbsp; With emotions of awe,
nor without those of fear, we climbed down the side of the rock
assisted by steps that were cut in it, and with some peril
reached the level of the darkened torrent; where, standing on a
projecting craig against which the river bounded, immersed in its
spray and deafened by its roar, we involuntarily clung to the
rock.&nbsp; The impression of terror subsiding, left us at
liberty to examine the features of the scene.&nbsp; Nearly over
our heads appeared the bridge attributed to the handy-works of
the Devil; <a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>but a less cunning workman might have thrown an arch
across a fissure of a few feet span; and indeed the native mason
who, about 50 years since, built the bridge now used, standing
perpendicularly over the old one, has constructed the best arch
of the two.&nbsp; The original bridge was built by the Monks of
Starflower Abbey near 700 years since.&nbsp; Nor is the singular
appearance of these arches devoid of picturesque effect; being
tastefully besprinkled with verdure, and relieved by the
intervention of numerous branchy trees: while the naked black
opposing cliffs, worn out into curious hollows by the torrents,
exhibit as bold a rocky chasm as ever was traced by the pencil of
Salvator.</p>
<p>On climbing from this hollow, we proceeded two or three
hundred yards to the left of the bridge, and again descended a
fearful track, to witness the grand <span class="smcap">falls of
the Mynach</span>.&nbsp; Under the direction of a guide, we
reached the ordinary station with little difficulty, where the
view of the cataract disclosed itself with considerable effect,
in four separate cascades; though, from the great fall&rsquo;s
being divided by the intervention of a projecting rock, they
appeared too much alike: the <a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>eye, accustomed to picturesque
disposition, in vain sought to fix itself on a pre-eminent
feature.&nbsp; I wished to get lower, but it seemed
impracticable: emboldened, however, by the example of our guide,
I clambered upon the edge of an immense perpendicular strata of
rock, to nearly the lower channel of the torrent; when the
cataract appeared in the most perfect disposition imaginable: the
great fall displayed itself in uninterrupted superiority, and the
lesser ones retired as subordinate parts.&nbsp; The perpendicular
descent of this cataract is not less than two hundred and ten
feet; the first fall is not more than twenty feet; the next
increases to sixty; the third diminishes to about twenty; then,
after a momentary pause, the torrent bounds over a shelving rook
in one tremendous fall of one hundred and ten feet, and soon
unites with the Rhydol, here a similar mountain torrent.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p114.jpg">
<img alt=
"Falls of the Mynach"
title=
"Falls of the Mynach"
src="images/p114.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>This grand cataract receives no inconsiderable augmentation of
terrific appearance from the black stratified rocks forming the
glen down which it thunders; nor can the beholder, however firm
his mind, divest himself of terror, while, near the bottom of an
abyss for ever denied a ray of sun, he <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>views the
menacing torrent bursting before him; or contemplates its foaming
course tearing at his feet among craigs that its fury has
disjoined.&nbsp; If he ventures to look up the acclivitous rock,
more real danger threatens his return, when a devious balance or
false step would ensure his certain destruction.&nbsp; Yet from
the horrors of this gloomy chasm some favoured projections
relieve the imagination, ornamented by the light and tasteful
penciling of the mountain ash, intermixed with vigorous sapling
oaks; while here and there a tree of riper years, unable to
derive support from the scanty soil, falls in premature decay a
prostrate ruin.&mdash;I have seen water-falls more picturesquely
grand than the cataract of the Mynach, but none more awfully so,
not even excepting the celebrated fells of Lowdore and Scaleforce
in Cumberland.</p>
<p>Climbing from this scene of terrors, I rejoined my companion,
and at the Haford Arms obtained a change of clothes; a comfort
which, although wet to the skin for several hours, I should still
longer have denied myself, had not the approach of night forced
me from the Mynach&rsquo;s interesting scenery.&nbsp; Our active
hostess quickly provided <a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>a tolerable dinner of mutton chops;
and, cheered by a good peat-fire and a bottle of wine, we
listened to the torrent&rsquo;s roar without dismay.&nbsp; On the
following morning we did not neglect to revisit the romantic
glen.&nbsp; The weather was fine; and, the effect of the late
rains having subsided, the bulk of the torrent had much
diminished; yet did the scene gain in beauty what it lost in
terrific grandeur; for the intermingling foliage, darting from
opposite sides of the glen, and reflecting various tints and
degrees of light, softened the asperitous black rocks, and spread
a lively net-work over the gloom.</p>
<p>Upon our preparing for the renewal of our journey, a material
difficulty occurred; my poney was so completely knocked up, that
he had not, as the jockeys phrase it, &ldquo;a leg to stand
on.&rdquo;&nbsp; The alternative in this case was to buy another;
and upon enquiry I found that my landlord had one to dispose of,
which was forthwith produced.&nbsp; This was a good-sized poney,
with plenty of bone, but ill-made; he had, however, an excellent
character: his knees too were sadly broken; but a circumstantial
tale shewed that to be the effect of accident, and not habitual
<a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>awkwardness: upon the whole, he did not seem dear at
the price demanded, which was only five guineas: a bargain was
therefore struck, the saddle transferred from the invalid to the
back of my new purchase; and after given directions for the
return of the former, which by the way incurred an expence more
than his value, we set forward for the celebrated grounds of
Hafod, about two miles distant.</p>
<p>Our road lay on the steep bank of the Mynach, commanding a
full view of the glen, and its romantic bridge.&nbsp; Then
ascending the Cwm Ystwith hill, through a current of clouds, we
gained from its summit an uninterrupted view of the whole range
of North Walean mountains, stretching from the English counties
to the great bay of Cardigan: the intervening hollows were
concealed by fields of mist; so that the uncultivated heights
exhibited a scene as rugged as when</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&mdash;Nature first made man,<br />
Ere the base laws of servitude began,<br />
And wild in woods the noble savage ran.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We now took a farewel view of the Mynach&rsquo;s glen, and
quitted its interesting scenery, with such sensations as one
feels in <a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>losing a friend whose intercourse has afforded both
pleasure and improvement.&nbsp; We then descended to the vale of
Ystwith, but unenlivened by its scenery, for a morning mist
floated through the valley and spread a veil over its
charms.&nbsp; A handsome park gate announced the entrance of
<span class="smcap">Hafod</span>, and the thundering of an unseen
waterfall formed a grand symphony to the spectacle that we were
soon to witness.&mdash;Almost immediately the cloud of mist
disappeared, rising like a huge curtain before us, and discovered
such an assemblage of beauties, of cheerful walks and silent
glens, of woody precipices, shadowy glades, garden thickets and
waterfalls, that, considered with the barren wilds of the
surrounding country, it secured a second Paradise rising from a
newly-subsided chaos.&nbsp; This charming place, occupying a deep
narrow valley, watered by the Ystwith, is the creation of Col.
Johnes, whose persevering genius has forced a mantle of wood upon
rocky precipices where nature seemed to deny the access of
verdure, and who in his elegant and useful projects of farther
improvement gives employment to the country around.&nbsp; Upon a
spot judiciously chosen, <a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>where the banks of the valley gently
incline, and the coverture of lofty woods afford a shelter from
the north-eastern winds, stands the mansion, with a sloping lawn
in front, commanding a comprehensive view of the enchanting
valley; which if Dryden could but see, he would wish to recall
the line,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;God never made his works for man to
mend.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On putting ourselves under the direction of the gardener, we
were first led to the kitchen-garden, furnished with extensive
forcing-houses, and replete with every necessary appendage.&nbsp;
The flower-garden also displayed its appropriate charms; but from
these atchievements of art we turned, without regret, to where
the bold hand of nature reared the scene in stupendous
majesty;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;There
along the dale,<br />
With woods o&rsquo;erhung, and shagg&rsquo;d with mossy rocks,<br
/>
Where on each hand the gushing waters play,<br />
And down the rough cascade white dashing fall,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>we passed, enamoured with the incessant though congenial
variety of our subject.&nbsp; After visiting the cold bath, a
small sequestered building, a mazy walk romantically traced by
the side of a brawling torrent, and amidst <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>tangled
shrubberies, led to a small cascade; and soon after a superior
waterfall engaged our attention, where the whole volume of the
Ystwith burst over a ledge of rocks in a composition truly grand
and picturesque.&nbsp; But a scene of awful sublimity disclosed
itself on exploring a dark cavernous passage in a rock and
reaching its extremity, where a lofty cascade of transcendent
beauty, throwing itself over a strata of black rocks, bounded
close to the opening of the cave, and shrouded the aperture with
its spray, as it became engulphed in a dark chasm beneath.</p>
<p>The towering mountains clothed with myriads of oaks, which
environ this remarkable valley, afford a diversity of walks and
combinations of view, to describe which words would be
inadequate, and prove at best but tedious.&nbsp; A walk of twelve
miles scarcely comprises a complete survey of the grounds, as we
are told; but, being pressed for time, our perambulation was
confined to a much smaller space; yet enough was seen to convince
us that this is one of the most delightful rural retreats in the
kingdom.</p>
<p>The mansion is a handsome modern edifice; in the Gothic style
of architecture; <a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>which idea is perfectly consonant with the romantic
cast of the scenery; and the general outline of the building is
certainly pleasing: but we were sorry that Col. Johnes had not
been better advised in the execution of this design, which though
we had read of, in one place, as built &ldquo;in the <i>most
correct taste</i>,&rdquo; and in another as &ldquo;a mansion in
the <i>Italian</i> style,&rdquo; we found to be a heterogeneous
jumble; wherein a bastard sort of Greek and Saxon architecture
was blended with the prevailing Gothic.&nbsp; The house
internally we understood to be richly fitted up, and furnished
with an excellent library, but did not visit it; for, though the
<i>demand</i> of five shillings for the gardener&rsquo;s
attendance was willingly paid, yet the same sum, which we found
would be required by the housekeeper, appeared to us more than
the show of any <i>Welch house</i> was worth.</p>
<p>There always appears to me something very unworthy in great
men allowing their servants to exact the sums that they do from
the spectators of their grandeur; but, such emoluments are taken
into the account of a servant&rsquo;s hire, and in some measure
contribute to the support of the great man&rsquo;s establishment:
<a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>as far
as they do this, they indirectly form part of his revenue; and in
that view I consider the <i>Grandee</i> as somewhat of a
mercenary showman, however <i>magnifique</i>.</p>
<p>A ride of nearly a mile extent, among delightful plantations,
led us out of Hafod; when, crossing the Ystwith over a good stone
bridge, we soon passed through a little romantic village on the
road to Tregarron, from whence the country continued wild,
without grandeur or interest, a succession of</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Barren heaths, and rushy meers,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>until the approach to Llandilo.&nbsp; In this mid-land route
the hills were much less continuous than round the coast, and the
valleys frequently extensive; but, overrun with peat-bogs, they
neither displayed fertility nor beauty.&nbsp; About half way to
Tregarron, a few hundred yards to the right of the road, were two
considerable hills, each crowned with a large ancient encampment:
we did not stop to examine them, but quickly turned off the road,
over moorlands on our left, in search of the remains of <span
class="smcap">Starflower</span> or <span class="smcap">Strata
Florida Abbey</span>.&nbsp; We had no track to direct us; nor <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>did a human
creature appear for many miles: after a fruitless wandering,
therefore, we gave up the object, with this consolation, that
almost the only relic remaining is an ornamented
circularly-arched gateway.&nbsp; Yet was this place, now lost in
a trackless desert, once of high importance.&nbsp; Strata Florida
Abbey (in British, Munachlog Ystrad flur) was founded anno 1164
for Cistertian Monks <a name="citation123"></a><a
href="#footnote123" class="citation">[123]</a> by Rhesus Prince
of South-Wales.&nbsp; In it many of the Welch Princes were
buried, and their acts kept and recorded: it suffered
considerably when Edward the First overran Wales, but was soon
after repaired.</p>
<p>A sloppy ride brought us to <span
class="smcap">Tregarron</span>: a poor straggling ill-built town,
situated in an abrupt hollow watered by an arm of the Tivy; yet,
plentifully interspersed with trees, it forms a pleasing relief
to the surrounding dreariness.&nbsp; Its church is a respectable
old building, and it boasts the dignity of a mayor.&nbsp; Our inn
here afforded us a capacious dish of eggs and bacon for dinner;
but, though it was not more than ordinarily strong and greasy for
the wilds of Wales, we grew delicate, and, <a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>leaving our
meal almost untasted, pursued our journey on the turnpike road to
Lampeter.&nbsp; About three miles from Tregarron, immediately on
the left of the road, we observed a large mound encircled by a
moat; but could not determine whether it was the site of an
antient citadel, or monumental of a deceased chieftain.&nbsp; In
the same neighbourhood is the church of Landewi-Brevi, where in
522, at a Holy Synod, St. David opposed the opinions of the
Pelagians.&nbsp; A prodigious petrified horn which is shewn at
the church is said to have remained there from that time; and in
the year 1187 Bishop Beck founded a college on the spot.&nbsp;
Several Roman inscribed stones appear in and about the church;
but at a place some distance southward of it, called Kaer Kestilh
(the field of the castles), a great number have at various times
been discovered, as also coins and Roman bricks.&nbsp; Dr. Gibson
considers this to be the Lovantinum of Ptolemy, in which opinion
he is followed by Mr. Horsley: Yet is this spot, the site of a
Roman town, and once occupied by its legions, now with difficulty
traced among barren fields remote from habitation:</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>&ldquo;No busy steps the grass-grown foot-way tread,<br
/>
But all the bloomy flush of life is fled.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From a fatiguing day&rsquo;s journey we gladly reposed at a
better inn than might be expected in so poor a town as <span
class="smcap">Lampeter</span>; and the following morning sallied
forth to visit a large old seat of Sir Robert Lloyd&rsquo;s;
which, we learned, &ldquo;exhibited a striking appearance with
its four great towers crowned with domes in the midst of
well-planted inclosures, but now scarcely inhabited.&rdquo;&nbsp;
A thick mist denied us this view; so, crossing the long old
bridge of Lampeter, we entered Carmarthenshire on our way to
Llandilo.&nbsp; Nothing can be imagined more dreary than the
first half of this ride; lying over an extensive range of lumpy
hills, as remote from any thing picturesque as profitable.&nbsp;
No tree, not a bush could be seen; and as we mournfully looked
round, where, except the miserable road on which we travelled, no
trace of society appeared, our disgusted sight would have even
rested with pleasure on a furze bush.&nbsp; From such a region of
sterility we gladly caught a gleam of cultivation, in some
distant hills bordering on Brecknockshire; but more gladly still,
on a sudden turn, we <a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>looked down on the pleasing little
valley <span class="smcap">Llansawel</span>, watered by a
crystaline branch of the Cothy.&nbsp; The sun had now dispersed
the mists through which we set out, and shone direct on the vale:
from its verdant level high hills, enjoying different degrees of
cultivation, rose on every side; and under one of them, at the
further end of the valley, the well-whitened village sparkled
through the intervening foliage.</p>
<p>This valley was immediately succeeded another called <span
class="smcap">Edwin&rsquo;s-ford</span>, a delightful spot, whose
high encircling hills are clothed with extensive plantations to
their very summits.&nbsp; In the bottom, is a large old manor
house belonging to Colonel Williams, beautified &ldquo;above,
below, around,&rdquo; with leaded mercuries, shepherdesses, and
sportsmen.&nbsp; Yet is this place, remaining in the genuine
style of King William&rsquo;s reign, with all its absurdities,
more interesting; as shewing us a specimen of that time, than if
it were patched up with modern improvements; or a new villa, of
the packing-case mode of building that now prevails.&nbsp; We
rode through the long avenues of trees that extend from the
house; and, quitting the valley, descended to another, <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>pleasingly
decorated with wood, and the ruin of Talley church.&nbsp; A
cheerful road, lined with</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hedge-row elms and coppice
green,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>now led us through a succession of swells and hollows, adorned
with numerous plantations, particularly those of Lord Robert
Seymour Conway&rsquo;s, to <span class="smcap">Llandilo</span>, a
pretty market town, seated on a descent to the justly famed vale
of Towey.</p>

<p>At Landilo we hastily put up our horses, anxious to feast on

and, learning that <span class="smcap">Newton Park</span>, the
delightful seat of Lord Dinevawr, afforded the most extensive and

through <a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>the leafy honours of this hill, conveyed us beneath
their dark umbrage to the top.&nbsp; We here climbed a massy
fragment of the ruin, and entered a falling apartment, which,
according to our guide&rsquo;s information, was once the
lady&rsquo;s dressing-room; where, reaching a Gothic window
overhung with ivy, a prospect burst upon us, teeming with the
most fascinating circumstances of verdant nature; a galaxy of
picturesque beauty, at which remembrance becomes entranced, and
description faulters!&nbsp; Immediately beneath, the expansive
vale of <span class="smcap">Towey</span> appears in the fullest
display of its charms; a hue of the richest green marks the
luxuriance of the soil through the course of the valley, which,
continually intersected with dusky hedge-rows, boasts all the
elegance of garden parterres.&nbsp; The translucid Towey here
wantons in perpetual variety among gay meadows and embowering
plantations, where the eye with pleasure traces its fantastic
meanders until they disappear behind projecting groves.&nbsp; The
rich wood that surrounds the castellated hill clothes a
precipitous descent to the water&rsquo;s edge, and, with other
sylvan decorations of Newton park, forms the nearmost boundary of
the vale.&nbsp; <a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>On the opposite side, a huge wild mountain rears its
head in desolation to the clouds; and beneath it Golden Grove, <a
name="citation130"></a><a href="#footnote130"
class="citation">[130]</a> despoiled of its leafy grandeur, now
appears in diminished beauty.&nbsp; Several smaller seats and
whitened hamlets start up in the valley, and, glistening through
their appendant groves, give life to the scene.&nbsp; A little
westward, <span class="smcap">Grongar hill</span>, immortalized
by the muse of Dyer, and now the property of one of his
descendants, advances on the vale and partly turns its course;
but at some distance further, a rugged hill, bearing the
mouldering fragments of Gruslwyn castle, proudly bestrides the
plain and terminates the picture.&nbsp; Our view of this scene
was favoured by the departing sun, which, just setting behind
Gruslwyn ruin, threw a glowing tint over the landscape; its
golden effulgence shone strongly on the varied hills, and gleamed
on the lofty groves that adorned <a name="page131"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>the vale; though the greater part of
it was obscured in grandly-projected shadows. <a
name="citation131"></a><a href="#footnote131"
class="citation">[131]</a></p>
<p>After a week&rsquo;s journey through an extensive tract of
country, with few exceptions as devoid of picturesque interest as
of productiveness, to come at once upon a scene so pregnant with
the bounty and beauty of nature, was a feast for the feelings of
philanthropy and picturesque enthusiasm that I shall never
forget; nor do I imagine that the coldest mortal could fail of
feeling a lively interest in so delightful a change&mdash;We</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&mdash;cast a longing ling&rsquo;ring look
behind&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>on leaving this scene to examine the ruined castle.&nbsp; The
extent of the apparent remains would lead one to consider it as a
place of small importance; but we traced the vestiges of a wall
and ditch at some distance from the conspicuous ruin, which
indicate it to have been of considerable dimensions.&nbsp; The
most <a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>noticeable parts are, the apartment already mentioned;
a massive round tower, the ancient keep; and a subterraneous
passage.&nbsp; Giraldus saw a castle here; but that was destroyed
in the year 1194, about six years after his Itinerary; it was,
however, soon rebuilt, and became the royal seat of the Princes
of South Wales; but frequently changed its masters, until it fell
to the crown of England.&nbsp; Henry the VIIth made a grant of it
to Sir Rice ap Thomas, Knight of the Garter, a lineal descendant
of the Welch Princes, and ancestor of the present
proprietor.&nbsp; It was inhabited until within these 50 years,
when the combustible part of it was destroyed by fire.</p>
<p>The mansion, built on a level about half a mile from the
castle, is a large quadrangular structure, with turrets at each
corner crowned with domes: it has lately been modernized; but
appears to have been founded about two centuries back.&mdash;An
avenue of trees extended from hence to the castle, which has
lately been broken into clumps, in harmony with the general
laying-out of the park.&nbsp; The hills of its strongly
undulating surface are profusely covered with wood, and the
hollows <a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>enjoy a luxuriance of pasturage that can scarcely be
equalled.&nbsp; On looking down some of these knolls, there
appears no poetical licence in Dyer&rsquo;s description:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Below me trees unnumber&rsquo;d rise,<br />
Beautiful in various dyes:<br />
The gloomy pines, the poplar blue,<br />
The yellow beech, the sable yew,<br />
The slender fir that taper grows,<br />
The sturdy oak with broad-spread boughs;<br />
And beyond the purple grove,<br />
Haunt of Phyllis, Queen of Love!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We often regretted that the picturesque ruin of the castle was
excluded from our view by the lofty trees that surround it: the
laudable jealousy with which Lord Dinevawr preserves the woody
embellishments of his park appeared to us as extending too far in
this instance; for were a few openings introduced, so as to
exhibit from various points the grand dimensions of some ivied
towers, a fine effect might be produced, and a picturesque
contrast obtained to the numerous woody swells that abound in
this beautiful domain.</p>
<p>The morning that we left Llandilo brought with it a scene of
affliction to the surrounding country: one of those deluging
rains which often do so much mischief in mountainous <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>countries
fell with unparalleled violence during the night; when the vast
accession of water, unable to discharge itself by the ordinary
channels, swept away trees, fences, small buildings, cattle, and
poultry in its devious course.&nbsp; Several mills were
destroyed; and many an industrious cottager, awakened by the
flood eddying round his bed, saw himself at once dispossessed of
the fruits of many years hard savings:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Fled to some eminence, the husbandman<br />
Helpless beheld the miserable wreck<br />
Driving along; his drowning ox at once<br />
Descending, with his labours scatter&rsquo;d round,<br />
He saw; and instant o&rsquo;er his shivering thought<br />
Came winter unprovided, and a train<br />
Of clamant children dear.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the storm&rsquo;s abating, we renewed our journey, and,
over a handsome stone bridge crossing the swollen Towey, which
had acquired a frightful hue from the red marle of the
neighbouring land, followed its course upon the road to
Llangadock.&nbsp; At the first turnpike we deviated to the right,
up a steep track rendered almost impracticable by loose craigs,
by the side of a romantic dingle, down whose dark hollow a small
cascade trickled with very good effect.&nbsp; In our ascent, <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>delightful
views were obtained of the upper vale of Towey, stretching from
Llandilo bridge to the vicinage of Llandovery.&nbsp; The distant
groves of Taliaris and Abermarle parks adorned this view, which
was only inferior to that from Dinevawr-castle.&nbsp; As we
advanced further, the rich prospect withdrew, and we found
ourselves entering upon the dreary wilds of the Black Mountains;
our track then became indistinct, wandering among rocks, floods,
and up-rooted trees, unenlivened by a single habitation or human
face.&nbsp; At length a cottage appeared, and we enquired our way
to Careg-cannon castle; but &ldquo;Dim Sarsnic&rdquo; <a
name="citation135"></a><a href="#footnote135"
class="citation">[135]</a> was all we could gather from the
inhabitants.&nbsp; Thus constrained to proceed at random, we
mounted a precipitous hill over a track that formed the bed of a
torrent, and discovered the object of our search upon a bold
rock, a considerable distance on our <a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>right: a little Welch farmer was
also comprized in this view, working hard to repair the damages
of the storm.&nbsp; We again enquired the best road to pursue,
and again were answered with &ldquo;Dim Sarsnic;&rdquo; he
however, signified to us that he would fetch some one, and
accordingly ran over two or three fields, and returned with his
daughter, a fine buxom girl who had picked up a little English at
Llandilo market.&nbsp; Without intreaty she offered to be our
guide; and, fixing in the ground a spade with which she had been
clearing a water-course, blythely led us, through mountainous
wilds, within a short distance of the object of our search.</p>
<p>As we ascended the rock, crowned with the frowning ruin of
Careg-cannon castle, a tempestuous cloud that broke against it
drenched us with a plentiful shower: we sought the shelter of the
building, but the wind raged with such violence, that we shrunk
from the mouldering battlements lest they should overwhelm
us.&nbsp; On crossing the ruin through its &ldquo;stormy
halls,&rdquo; we again recoiled on finding ourselves upon the
brink of a tremendous precipice, which, except on the side by
which we ascended, encompasses the castle in a perpendicular <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>rocky cliff
upwards of four hundred feet in height.&nbsp; Then climbing among
the mossy fragments of the castle, we discovered an aperture in
the ground connected with a long subterraneous gallery dug
through the solid rock, and lighted by windows cut in the cliff,
though not visible from any situation without.&nbsp; In exploring
this strange recess, rendered more fearful by the loud shrieks of
the wind, we advanced, not without sensations of awe: it
terminated in a large gloomy cavern, fit scene for</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Murders, rapes, and
massacres,<br />
Acts of black night, abominable deeds,<br />
Complots of mischiefs, treason, villanies<br />
Ruthful to hear.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this place we waited the passing of the storm, conjecturing
it to have continued formerly to some adjacent spot, so as to
form a sally-port or secret communication from the castle.&nbsp;
On our return we felt more at liberty to examine the features of
the ruin, which proved of the simplest construction, totally
without ornament or a single Gothic form, and consisting of one
irregular court with towers at each angle.&nbsp; If the Britons
had any castles of stone before the arrival of the Normans <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>(a fact
doubted by some antiquaries), I should imagine this to be one;
although a late tourist, I know not on what authority, ascribes
its erection to the time of Henry the First.&nbsp; The position
must have been formerly impregnable, and its rough aspect marks
it to have been constructed for the mere business of war.&nbsp;
By</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;a
lonely tower,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash;whose mournful chambers hold,<br />
To night-struck Fancy dreams, the yelling Ghost,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>we passed from this wild abode, and floundered among
ditch-like tracks to recover the high road from Llandilo to
Swansea.&nbsp; In a romantic hollow we were stopped by a branch
of the Towey; which, though in ordinary times an inconsiderable
rivulet, was now swelled to a deep and menacing torrent.&nbsp;
Here we found a party of men and women peasants on the opposite
side, in doubt whether it might be safely crossed; but at length
one of the men stripped and waded over, thus satisfying us that
the ford was practicable.&nbsp; The rest followed; the men first
getting rid of the lower part of their dress;&mdash;a trouble
avoided by the females, who, unused to the encumbrance of shoes
and stockings, had <a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>only to hold up their clothes to the highest extent;
and, thus prepared, the whole party moved toward us.&nbsp;
Viewing this remnant of barbarity with disgust, we at the same
time felt uneasy for the situation of the girls: but we might
have spared ourselves that pain; their countenances proved them
to be unembarrassed by the consciousness of shame; nor did their
eyes wander from the precise line in which they were going.&nbsp;
The transaction was to them a matter of perfect indifference.</p>

<p>It may reasonably be supposed, that the indecent customs of
the Welch operate against the observance of chastity: yet seeing
that the Welch are by no means deficient in that excellence, it
may be supposed that were such scenes less frequent they would be
so; but, as they are continually recurring, the imagination has
no time to effervesce; it is at once saturated with naked facts,
and on that principle the ebullitions of passion are kept
under.&nbsp; On the one hand, those strong bulwarks decency and
delicacy are done away; but on the other, the mind, fully
informed, is not irritated by the conjurations of fancy; which
may be a pretty fair set-off.&nbsp; Yet, without <a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>doubt,
their strongest safeguard exists in the considerative defence;
for the moral turpitude and political infamy of unchastity is
recognized in Wales to an extent that can hardly be conceived in
circles of modern refinement: even at this day, in districts not
yet drawn within the imposing vortex of trade, <a
name="citation140"></a><a href="#footnote140"
class="citation">[140]</a> a golden age of innocence may be
discovered, where bastardy is unknown, or known but in recorded
instances, in which the man is properly consigned to equal
disgrace with the female offender.</p>
<p>Our travelling continued in rocky tracks, at the rate of a
mile an hour, until we recovered the Llandilo road; from which we
soon turned off, on the right, to visit Glenheir waterfall, in
the grounds of Mr. Dubaison, <a name="page141"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>about five miles south of
Llandilo.&nbsp; At this place the Loughor river pursues its
course between steep banks clothed with various trees and
shrubs.&nbsp; On one of the descents a walk is traced, with some
ingenuity, in front of a small picturesque cascade formed by a
tributary stream to the Loughor.&nbsp; This might be mistaken for
the object sought; but, crossing a rustic bridge, the eye on a
sudden encounters the whole river rushing beneath a portal of
trees, and throwing itself over a ledge of black rock in a single
fall of eighteen feet.&nbsp; The effect of the whole, seen
through the gloom of pendent trees, is undoubtedly striking;
though, it must be confessed, the sheet of water presenting the
formality of an unbroken square is somewhat unpicturesque.&nbsp;
The person who attended us pointed out the effects of the torrent
at fifteen feet above its surface, to which height it was swelled
in the morning by the late storm; a greater rise than was ever
known before: the cataract then exhibited a scene more
tremendously grand than imagination can picture, or words
describe; yet some idea may be formed in conceiving so vast a
bulk of water, bursting over the precipice, stunning with its
roar, <a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>and filling the atmosphere with its spray; while
up-rooted trees, the shattered fragments of buildings, and other
ruins, swept headlong on by the irresistible torrent, would
illustrate its terrors, and complete a spectacle great
indeed!&nbsp; Yet, alas, at how high a purchase, appeared from
the lamentations of the neighbourhood!&nbsp; Nor were we without
a share in the general calamity; for, crossing the Loughor at a
ford about two miles further, my poney on a sudden slipped out of
his depth, and we had separately to swim for our lives to the
opposite bank.&nbsp; This disagreeable business was much
aggravated; for my books, papers, and some other articles which I
carried in a leather-case behind the saddle, were completely
soaked, and several drawings utterly spoiled.&nbsp; My companion,
having a taller horse, escaped, with only his boots full of
water.&nbsp; Here it may not be amiss to apprize the traveller
through Wales, that these fords (frequently occurring) are not
unattended with danger after great falls of rain: at such times,
a careful enquiry should be made of the people near them: a
precaution that would have saved us our ducking; for it
afterwards appeared, that no other travellers <a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>had crossed
the ford during the day, but avoided it by taking a circuitous
route.</p>
<p>In this plight we jogged on upwards of eight miles, with the
unwelcome gloom of the Black Mountains on our left, and a
pleasant diversified country on our right, to the village of
Pont-ar-dulas, but which we did not reach before evening.&nbsp;
The comfortable inn at this place afforded us a change of apparel
and good cheer, that soon dissipated the inconveniences of our
journey.&nbsp; On the following morning we rose early, and then
found the place to possess many traits of picturesque attraction,
being seated near a rapid river, and agreeably interspersed with
woods.&nbsp; Thence we had a pleasant ride to Swansea; where we
rejoined a party of our friends at breakfast, after a
fortnight&rsquo;s excursion.</p>
<p>During our stay in this town, protracted to several days by
its agreeable society, Mrs. Hatton, mistress of the
bathing-house, and sister of the English Melpomene, exhibited her
theatric powers on the humble boards of Swansea theatre.&nbsp;
But, labouring under the misfortune of lameness, and the
encumbrance of more human flesh than I ever before saw crowded in
one female figure, <a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>she was obliged to go through her task, the recitation
of Alexander&rsquo;s Feast, <i>sitting</i>: notwithstanding which
<i>weighty</i> drawback, the lady did not fail to exhibit a vivid
tincture of the family genius.&nbsp; Here too we were gratified
with the news of an event, before whose solid advantages the
victories of a century sink, in a rational estimate, like
glittering tinsel before massive ingots.&nbsp; I was awakened at
an early hour by the loud huzzas of the towns-people, and the
frequent discharge of cannon from vessels in the harbour.&nbsp;
The ships displayed their gayest colours; and the people, in
dancing through the streets, congratulated each other on the long
wished-for blessing of <span class="smcap">Peace</span>!&nbsp;
The chagrin of two or three provision-monopolizers, and a few
others whose interest was in opposition to the public weal, with
the old subterfuge that it was not the proper time for peace,
covering a real sentiment of endless war, passed unnoticed, nor
formed a perceptible speck on the brilliancy of the
people&rsquo;s joy!</p>

<p class="gutsumm">NEATH ABBEY, TOWN, AND CASTLE&mdash;THE
KNOLL&mdash;BRITON FERRY&mdash;FUNEREAL
RITES&mdash;ABERAVON&mdash;MARGAM&mdash;ABBEY
RUIN&mdash;PILE.</p>
<p>Our tour now took an eastward direction.&nbsp; Crossing
Swansea river by an exceeding good ferry, and passing a region of
furnaces, we traversed a considerable hill to the neighbouring
valley of <span class="smcap">Neath</span>; a spot that might be
deemed pleasing, were it not overhung with the smoke of numerous
manufactories, and its soil blackened with coal-works and
rail-ways. <a name="citation145"></a><a href="#footnote145"
class="citation">[145]</a>&nbsp; Neath abbey is a short distance
<a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>west of
the town, and its remains are extensive.&nbsp; Besides the abbey
church, the walls of the offices and other apartments are yet
standing; but, undecorated with verdure, and partaking of the
sable hue that impinges on every object around, it fails to
create an idea of beauty or grandeur.&nbsp; As we were exploring
the dark recesses of the ruin, a number of haggard forms on a
sudden darted from various apertures, and eagerly pressed toward
us.&nbsp; Their wan countenances, half hidden by black matted
hair, bore the strongest expression of misery; which was further
heightened by a scanty ragged apparel, that scarcely covered
their meagre limbs: upon their whole appearance one might have
asked with Banquo,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What
are these,<br />
So wither&rsquo;d, and so wild in their attire,<br />
That look not like th&rsquo; inhabitants o&rsquo;the earth,<br />
And yet are on&rsquo;t?&mdash;You should be women;<br />
And yet your beards forbid me to interpret<br />
That you are so.&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>The
poor creatures were the wives of miners, and women that worked in
the manufactories, who burrowed and brought up their families in
the cells of the ruin.&nbsp; Unceasing drudgery, however, was
unable to obtain them the necessaries of life; much less a taste
of those comforts, to which the exertion of useful labour might
seem to have a just claim.&nbsp; An old woman, bent nearly double
with years,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Of ashy semblance, meagre, pale, and
bloodless,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>gave us her account of the ruin.&nbsp; She shewed us the
nuns&rsquo; dining-room, the roof of which is still entire,
supported by Saxon, or rather early Norman pillars and
arches.&nbsp; From the refectory we passed to what was once the
dormitory, and were shewn a nauseous dungeon, in which, as the
legend of the ruin relates, offending nuns were wont to be
confined.&nbsp; This abbey was built by Richard de Granville and
Constance his wife, in the reign of Henry the First, for
Cistertian monks, and dedicated to the Holy Trinity: at the
dissolution of monasteries its revenues were valued at
150<i>l.</i> <i>per annum</i>.&nbsp; The abbey-house, about a
century and a half since, formed an admired seat of the
Hobby&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>Neath, the Nidum of Antoninus, was formerly of greater
extent and importance than at present; for, notwithstanding its
flourishing manufactories, it now makes but a poor dirty
appearance.&nbsp; The Castle, now an inconsiderable ruin, was
built by Richard de Granville, one of Fitzhammon&rsquo;s knights,
upon the site of a British fortress of very antient foundation;
and was taken and in part burnt by Prince Llewelyn A.D.
1231.&nbsp; The Neath river limits that tract of country called
Gower; it also formed the western boundary of the Lordship of
Glamorgan, which anciently extended eastward to the river
Usk.&nbsp; The latter district fell under the dominion of the
Normans in the following manner.</p>
<p>In the year 1090, Jestyn, lord of Glamorgan, having a
difference with Rees, King of Wales, had recourse to arms, and
solicited the assistance of Fitzhammon, an Anglo-Norman
chieftain, to support his cause.&nbsp; The confederates were
successful; but, as it generally happens when foreign aid is
required in domestic disputes, the remedy proved worse than the
disease; for, on the plea that the conditions of their compact
had not been fulfilled, Fitzhammon collected his forces, <a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>attacked
Jestyn, and deprived him of his life and territory.&nbsp;
Fitzhammon shared the spoil with twelve knights who accompanied
him, rewarding each with a manor.&nbsp; Now, as a dominion thus
acquired must be supported by the iron arm of coercion, we find
the first attention of the conquerors directed to rearing
fortresses on their domains; and shortly afterwards an appendant
creation of religious houses makes its appearance, as a salvo for
the slaughter and injustice that purchased their greatness.&nbsp;
To this foundation most of the picturesque ruins that we are
about to examine in Glamorganshire, and part of Monmouthshire,
may be traced: it will, therefore, be necessary not to lose sight
of this point of history.</p>
<p>We did not fail to admire the <span
class="smcap">Knoll</span>, a castellated seat of Sir Herbert
Mackworth&rsquo;s, occupying the summit of a hill at the
termination of a noble lawn.&nbsp; The fine views which its
elevation commands, encompassed by hanging woods, and extensive
plantations, its shady walks and picturesque cascades, render it
a place deservedly attractive.&nbsp; Beneath the tufted hills of
this estate, we passed <a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>from Neath in our way to Briton
ferry; and soon remarked a single stone monument <a
name="citation150"></a><a href="#footnote150"
class="citation">[150]</a>, a massive paralellopiped, on a height
to our left: another immediately afterwards appeared in a field
close to the road on the right.</p>
<p>From these monuments of other times, however, the rich hanging
woods and open groves of <span class="smcap">Briton ferry</span>
attracted our interest, clothing that charming domain of Lord
Vernon&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The extensive plantations spread over several bold hills
westward of the Neath river, whose broad translucid stream here
emerges in a fine sweep between high woody banks, partly broken
into naked cliffs, and soon unites with the sea.&nbsp; From a
delightful shady walk impendent over the stream, we branched off
into an &ldquo;alley green&rdquo; that led us up a steep hill
covered with large trees and tangled underwood: the ascent was
judiciously traced where several bare craigs projecting from the
soil formed an apposite contrast to the luxuriant verdure that
prevailed around.&nbsp; On <a name="page151"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 151</span>gaining the summit the charms of
Briton ferry disclosed themselves in</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;An ample theatre of Sylvan grace&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>of more than common beauty; beyond which the Bristol channel,
bounded by the aerial tint of its opposite coast, formed the
distance.&nbsp; But from a roaming prospect the eye gladly
returned to repose on the local beauties of the scene; the tufted
knoll, the dark glade, and the majestic river.&nbsp; In
returning, we passed the mansion, a very ordinary building; but
paused on the neat simplicity of the village-church adjoining,
and its well-ordered cemetery.</p>
<p>The custom of planting ever-greens over the graves of departed
friends, and bedecking them with flowers at certain seasons of
the year, is, here attended to with peculiar care; and to this
pleasing tribute of affection, characteristic of Wales, David
ap-Gwillim, a Welch bard who flourished about the middle of the
fourteenth century, thus sweetly alludes in one of his odes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;O whilst thy season of flowers, and thy
tender sprays thick of leaves remain; I will pluck the roses from
the brakes; the <a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>flowerets of the meads, and gems of the woods; the
vivid trefoils, beauties of the ground, and the gaily smiling
bloom of the verdant herbs, to be offered to the memory of a
chief of fairest fame: Humbly will I lay them on the grave of
Ivor!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shakspeare also, with exquisite tenderness:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;With fairest flowers while summer lasts<br
/>
I&rsquo;ll sweeten thy sad grave: thou shalt not lack<br />
The flower that&rsquo;s like thy face, pale Primrose; nor<br />
The azur&rsquo;d Harebell, like thy veins; no, nor<br />
The leaf of Eglantine, whom not to slander<br />
Outsweeten&rsquo;d not thy breath.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Highly pleased with Briton ferry, we proceeded along the
coast, and passed through the little town of <span
class="smcap">Aberavon</span>.&nbsp; Its copper and tin works
added no charms to the verdant fertility of this part of the
country, which appeared ornamented with several gentlemen&rsquo;s
seats, and well planted hills; but, grandly rising above
comparison, &ldquo;the mighty hill of <span
class="smcap">Margam</span>,&rdquo; a steep mountain entirely
shaded with oaks from the base to its
&ldquo;cloud-cap&rsquo;t&rdquo; summit, arrested our chief
attention.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<p>Margam park, belonging to Mr. Talbot, is chiefly to be noticed
for its orangery; <a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>a magnificent pavilion of the Doric order, 327 feet in
length, wherein the orange-trees are arranged in unfavourable
weather: but on our visit, these trees, to the amount of a
hundred and fifty, from six to ten feet high, and all in full
bearing, were agreeably disposed in a sequestered part of the
garden. <a name="citation153"></a><a href="#footnote153"
class="citation">[153]</a>&nbsp; Margam abbey was until within
these few years the mansion of the estate; but it is now pulled
down: some low ruins, however, remain, and the walls of its
elegant but neglected chapter-house.&nbsp; This structure is thus
described by Mr. Wyndham, who visited the spot about thirty years
since: &ldquo;It is an elegant Gothic building, of a date
subsequent to that of the church.&nbsp; Its vaulted roof is
perfect, and supported by a clustered column rising from the
centre of the room.&nbsp; The plan of this chapter-house is an
exact circle, fifty feet in diameter.&nbsp; The just proportion
of the windows, and the delicate ribs of the arches, which all
rise from the centre column and the walls, gradually diverging to
their respective points above, must please the eye of every
spectator; <a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>and, what is uncommon in light Gothic edifices, the
external elevation is as simple and uniform as its internal,
there being no projecting buttresses to disturb or obstruct its
beauty.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The preservation of this building led
me to conclude, that much attention had been given to the lead
that originally covered it; but, to my astonishment, I heard that
the lead had long since been removed, and that the only security
of the roof against the weather was a thick <i>oiled paper</i>,
which by no means prevented the rain from penetrating and
filtering through the work.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Wyndham concludes by
trusting, that, as the present proprietor is a lover of
antiquities, the deficiency would be corrected.&nbsp; But,
unfortunately, the edifice was left to its fate, and the roof
soon fell in: thus one of the finest specimens of Gothic
architecture in this or any other country is lost to the eye of
taste and science.</p>
<p>Just perceptible from the turf we traced the foundation of the
Abbey Church, and the bases of four clustering pillars that most
probably supported the tower; the steps of the altar were also
visible, besprinkled with grass; <a name="page155"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>and, turning over some fragments, we
picked up part of the chalice for containing holy water, and
several of those coloured glazed tiles which were used in the
early Norman age for paving principal buildings, but commonly
called Roman tiles.&nbsp; We were informed by Mr. Snook, the
intelligent gardener of the place, who was present at the
dilapidation of the abbey, that the pavement formed with these
tiles was the lowermost of three which were then removed; and
that on digging deeper they came to an immense heap of human
bones.&nbsp; This pavement is still in many places remaining,
though nearly concealed by a covering of moss.&nbsp; Many curious
sculptured stones of high antiquity are to be met with in the
park, and in the village adjoining; the church of which presents,
in its elevation, a more pleasing symmetry and composition than
any Gorman work that I remember to have seen. <a

class="citation">[155]</a>&nbsp; A shady walk, carried beneath
the leafy mantle of Margam&rsquo;s hill, passes a ruined chapel,
and a loggan or rocking-stone, in its way to the <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>summit,
where a prospect of uncommon extent greets the beholder.&nbsp;
Eglis Nunne, about two miles south of Margam, now a farmhouse,
was formerly a nunnery subject to that abbey.</p>
<p>Renewing our journey, we left Kenfig on our right, where some
vestiges of a castle built by one of Fitzhammon&rsquo;s knights
are said to appear, and proceeded to <span
class="smcap">Pyle</span>.&nbsp; The inn here, built by Mr.
Talbot, and which might be mistaken for a nobleman&rsquo;s seat,
affords excellent accommodation for travellers, who are
frequently induced to make it their head-quarters while visiting
the several objects in the neighbourhood.&mdash;Leaving Pyle, we
soon found ourselves on Newton Down, and from its height
discovered the range of hills forming the opposite boundary of
the vale of Cowbridge, in which a bold hill crowned with Penline
Castle was eminently conspicuous.&nbsp; On looking back, we were
pleased with a comprehensive view of the country that we had
lately traversed: beyond the wide bay of Swansea, the whitened
habitations of Ostermouth caught our eye; the sulphureous clouds
revolving from the works of Swansea and Neath were only divided
<a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>by the
projection of Kilway hill; and the picturesque knolls of Briton
ferry appeared sunk into comparative littleness beneath the
towering dimensions of Margam&rsquo;s shady mountain.&mdash;Our
tour now became thickly interspersed with baronial castles and
other monuments of feudal times, interesting either by their
historical events or picturesque decay.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ogmore castle</span> is situated on the
eastern bank of the river Ogmore, near the road to Cowbridge; its
remains, however, are very inconsiderable, consisting merely of
the keep and some outer walls.&nbsp; Caradoc, in his History of
Wales, says, that the manor and castle of Ogmore were bestowed by
Fitzhammon on William de Londres, one of his knights; from which
its foundation may be dated prior to the Norman conquest.&nbsp;
The manor courts are still held in a thatched hovel near it,
which appears like an overgrown <a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>pig-stye.&nbsp; Here, according to
the custom of the times, a religious institution followed the
acquisition of power.&nbsp; William de Londres, or his descendant
John, built <span class="smcap">Ewenny Priory</span>, at the
distance of a mile from the castle, and also near the road to
Cowbridge: but in this the proprietor seems not to have lost
sight of his worldly interest; for the strong embattled walls and
towers that appear among the ruins of this building would lead
one to consider it as intended not less for the purposes of war
than of priestcraft; and its situation on the bank of the Wenny
was admirably adapted for the defence of that part of his
domain.&nbsp; In the hall of the house, a gloomy building, are
several racks, which appear to have been used for the lodging of
arms.&nbsp; The church is a venerable massive structure, wherein
unornamented heavy arches repose on short bulky columns of the
rudest workmanship: it contains a monument of Paganus de
Turbeville, supposed to be the grandson of Fitzhammon&rsquo;s
knight of that name.&nbsp; The thick columns, plain capital, and
circular arches of this edifice, denote it to be of the earliest
Norman architecture; and might lead one to suppose it to <a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>be of Saxon
origin, did not historical facts invalidate the conjecture.&nbsp;
Leland says that it was founded for Benedictine monks; but
neither he, Dugdale, nor Tanner, gives us the date of its
foundation.&nbsp; A.D. 1141 it was made a cell of St.
Peter&rsquo;s of Gloucester.</p>
<p>Not far from Ewenny, on the sea-coast, is <span
class="smcap">Dunraven-house</span>, or castle, as it is called
by Caradoc; a misshapen dismal building, only to be admired for
its situation on a lofty sea promontory, commanding extensive
prospects.&nbsp; William de Londres, Lord of Ogmore (says
Caradoc) won the lordships of Kydwelhy and Carnewihion in
Carmarthenshire from the Welchmen; and gave to Sir Arnold Butler,
his servant, the castle and manor of Dunraven.&nbsp; It continued
a long time in the possession of his descendants; but at length
fell to the Vaughans, the last of whom, as tradition relates, was
such an unprincipled wretch, that he set up lights, and used
other devices to mislead seamen, in order that they might be
wrecked on his manor.&nbsp; But his crimes did not escape
punishment; for it is said that three of his sons were drowned in
one day by the following accidents.&nbsp; Within sight of the
house is a <a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>large rock called the Swancar, dry only at low water;
to which two of his sons went in a boat to divert themselves: but
not taking care to fasten their vessel, on the rising of the tide
it was washed away, and they left to the horrors of their fate;
which was inevitable, as the family had no other boat, nor was
there any other in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; Their distress was
seen from the house; and in the confusion their infant brother,
being left alone, fell into a vessel of whey, and was drowned
almost at the same instant with the other two.&nbsp; This was
universally looked upon as a judgement for the iniquities
abovementioned; and Mr. Vaughan was so struck with the
transaction, that he immediately sold the house to Mr. Wyndham,
ancestor of the present proprietor.&mdash;Two extraordinary
caverns, about a mile westward of the house, we neglected to
visit: the one called the Cave is described to be a passage worn
through a projecting stack of rocks, running parallel with the
sea-shore, and forming a kind of rude piazza, with an entrance to
the south, of very grand effect.&nbsp; The other, called the
Windhole, is a deep cavern, a little to the east of the Cave: its
depth from the entrance <a name="page162"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>measures seventy-seven yards.&nbsp;
There are two or three small fissures through the roof of the
cavern to the land above, a considerable distance from the edge
of the cliff; over which if a hat be laid, it will be blown back
into the air with considerable violence; but this only happens
when the wind blows fresh from the South-east.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Donatt&rsquo;s Castle</span>, a few
miles further on the coast, and about five south-west of
Cowbridge, is an extensive structure, of much antique beauty, and
is still partially inhabited.&nbsp; Its garden, descending in
terraces from the south wall, was formerly much admired, but
now</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sunk are the bowers in shapeless rain
all,<br />
And the long grass o&rsquo;ertops the mould&rsquo;ring wall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although loftily situated, the castle is so surrounded with
high groves, as only to be seen with advantage from some heights
in the adjoining park: on one of them is a watch-tower, which
affords a prospect truly grand and extensive.&nbsp; This castle
is of very remote foundation, although the greater part of the
building indicates the work of latter ages.&nbsp; We learn from
Powell&rsquo;s translation of Caradoc, <a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>that the
castle and manor of St. Denewit, or St. Donatt, was apportioned
to Sir William le Esterlong, alias Stradling, on the conquest of
Glamorgan.&nbsp; The Stradlings, outliving the descendants of all
the other twelve Knights, held it for 684 years; but they
becoming extinct, the estate fell to Busy Mansell, Esq. <a
name="citation163"></a><a href="#footnote163"
class="citation">[163]</a></p>
<p>Between St. Donatt&rsquo;s and Cowbridge is Lantwit, a poor
village, but once a large borough town.&nbsp; On the north side
of its church are some old British relics, consisting of high
carved stones; but whether sepulchral or otherwise is not
determined.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Llanbithian</span>, or
<span class="smcap">St. Quintin&rsquo;s Castle</span>, is
situated about half a mile south of Cowbridge.&nbsp; The leading
feature of this ruin is a massive gateway, now converted into a
barn; which, as well as the other parts, denotes considerable
original strength, and is said to have been built prior to the
arrival of Fitzhammon.&nbsp; The castle and manor fell to the
share of Sir Robert St. Quintin on the division of Glamorgan; but
it passed from his descendants in the reign of <a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>Henry the
Third, and is now the property of Lord Windsor.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Cowbridge</span> is a neat little town seated on
the banks of a small river. <a name="citation164"></a><a
href="#footnote164" class="citation">[164]</a></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Penline Castle</span>, loftily seated on a
bold hill, and commanding a prospect of uncommon diversity and
extent, is about a mile distant from Cowbridge.&nbsp; From the
lines of Edward Williams, a native poet, it may appear that it
serves as a barometer for the neighbourhood:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When the hoarse waves of Severn are
screaming aloud,<br />
And Penline&rsquo;s lofty castle&rsquo;s involv&rsquo;d in a
cloud;<br />
If true the old proverb, a shower of rain<br />
Is brooding above and will soon drench the plain.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This structure is of very ancient date: in some parts of the
building the stones are laid in the <i>herring-bone</i> fashion;
a mode observed in the oldest parts of Guildford, Corfe, and
others of the most ancient castles.&nbsp; The mansion near to the
ruin was built by Mr. Sergeant Sey, and is now possessed by Miss
Gwinit, by a bequest of the late Lady Vernon&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>A
retrograde movement, hastily performed in a shower of rain,
brought us to Bridgend, a straggling little town, built on the
opposing banks of the river Ogmore.&nbsp; From this place a road
passes to the village of <span class="smcap">Coity</span> and its
dismantled castle.&nbsp; This ruin stands on a plain ground, and
is prettily interspersed with various trees and underwood: its
foundation is generally attributed to Paganus de Turbeville, one
of Fitzhammon&rsquo;s knights.&mdash;The continuance of our ride
to Llantrissent boasted little interest; until, making a curve
near the seven-mile stone, when the wide undulating vale of
Cowbridge exhibited a most extensive tract of beautiful
fertility: among the high hills circumscribing the vale, that
sustaining Penline castle rose with superior importance.&nbsp;
The whole laid out in rich pastures and meadows, continually
intersected with tufted inclosures, and enlivened with embowered
hamlets and detached whitened buildings, formed a <i>coup
d&rsquo;&oelig;il</i> of considerable interest.</p>
<p>The old town of <span class="smcap">Llantrissent</span>
appeared within a small distance of us, long before we arrived at
it: for, perched upon the summit of a high hill of remarkable
steepness, it <a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>was only by a circuitous road, then of sufficiently
fatiguing ascent, that it could be approached.&nbsp; This place,
comprised nearly in one narrow irregular street, and made up of
poor Gothic habitations, has so little of modern appearance
engrafted on it, that it may be interesting as a specimen of
ancient times, but scarcely in any other respect.&nbsp; The
castle is nearly all destroyed; the fragment of a lofty round
tower, and the vestiges of its outworks, nearly concealed by
tangled shrubs, being all the remains of it.&nbsp; The church is
a large Norman edifice, and from the cemetery a wonderful
prospect is obtained of the surrounding country: although a hazy
state of the atmosphere denied us the whole of its extent, enough
remained to assure us that it must be considerable.</p>
<p>Pont-y-pridd, or New Bridge, was our next destination.&nbsp;
My companion went forward to secure accommodation at the
Bridgewater Arms, a comfortable inn about half a mile beyond it,
while I was engaged in sketching some subjects about
Llantrissent; at which task I incautiously protracted my stay</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>&mdash;&ldquo;until the approach of night,<br />
The skies warm blushing with departing light<br />
When falling dews with spangles deck&rsquo;d the glade,<br />
And the low sun had lengthen&rsquo;d ev&rsquo;ry
shade.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I proceeded from Llantrissent, cultivation diminished; and
from that fertile and populous district, bordering the Severn, I
found myself entering upon the unfrequented wilds of the interior
country.&nbsp; It soon became so dark, that I could but just
distinguish the broken road that I was travelling; which,
although a Welch turnpike, a modern farmer in England would be
ashamed to own for his cartway.&nbsp; Not a human face or
habitation presented itself, nor any relief from silence, except
the uncheering note of the screech owl.&nbsp; At length, however,
the distant murmur of a waterfall saluted me; which, growing
louder as I advanced, presently accumulated to a hoarse roar;
and, by the direction of the sound, it appeared that I was
travelling on a precipice above the torrent.&nbsp; A plentiful
shower falling at this instant did not add to the comforts of my
situation; and I found by the motion of the horse, that I was on
a steep descent; while his frequent slides and stumbles proved
that <a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>he
was on very rugged ground, and probably out of any track.&nbsp;
In this dilemma imagination, ever active in magnifying concealed
danger, pictured my situation as tottering on the brink of some
such chasm as that of the Devil&rsquo;s bridge.&nbsp; Here I
might have exclaimed with Ossian&rsquo;s Colma: &ldquo;It is
night; I am alone, forlorn on the hill of storms.&nbsp; The wind
is heard on the Mountains; the torrent shrieks down the
rock.&nbsp; No hut receives me from the rain; forlorn on the hill
of winds.&rdquo;&nbsp; But to remain under such apprehensions
were worse than to encounter danger, and I slowly moved on in
almost total darkness; until, making a sudden turn, I beheld the
tops of the neighbouring hills illumined in a strange
manner.&nbsp; In a few moments a gleam of light, transmitted by
reflection through an opening in some trees, shone on my track,
and discovered a dark huge figure standing at my horse&rsquo;s
head.&nbsp; I was scarcely collected from my surprize when my
bridle was forcibly arrested, and a loud but unintelligible voice
seemed to demand that I should stop.&nbsp; Already was I
conceiving how to repel the attack, when the man, observing that
I did not understand Welch, civilly accosted me <a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>in
imperfect English, and assured me that I was on the edge of a
precipice.&nbsp; Nor did he leave me with this service, but
kindly led my horse to the little village of <span
class="smcap">Pont-y-pridd</span>, then within a short
distance.&nbsp; Here, while regaling over a mug of ale, my
conductor accounted for the light that surprized me: it proceeded
from an immense bonfire of a party of colliers in some distant
mountains, rejoicing at the blessing of peace.&nbsp; At this
place I determined to fix my quarters; nor could the offer of a
guide and lanthorn, to conduct me to the superior accommodation
of the Bridgewater arms, induce me to tempt again the dangers of
the night, or quit the coarse barley bread, salt butter, and
miserable beer of the village alehouse.</p>
<p>Early in the morning my companion rejoined me, when we visited
Pont-y-pridd, the celebrated bridge of Glamorganshire.&nbsp; This
extraordinary piece of masonry consists of a single arch, whose
chord is 147 feet, thrown across the Taffe.&nbsp; William Edward,
an ingenious mason of this country, who built it, failed in two
preceding attempts, which would have proved his ruin; but the
gentry in the neighbourhood laudably supported <a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>ported his
ingenuity, although at first unsuccessfully exerted, and enabled
him to complete the present structure.&nbsp; The great beauty of
this arch arises from the simplicity of its construction, and
indeed from its very defect as a roadway; for the passage over
the bridge is not sloped away into the adjoining roads, as it
might be; but precipitately descends on each side, following the
line of the arch.&nbsp; This circumstance, and its being defended
with only a very low parapet, gives the bridge a remarkably light
appearance.&nbsp; Situated in a romantic hollow, and abruptly
jetting from the bold woody banks of the river, it looks a magic
bow thrown across by the hands of fairies.</p>
<p>Two waterfalls in this neighbourhood deserve notice.&nbsp; One
occurs about half a mile above the bridge.&nbsp; We proceeded to
it through a delightful sylvan path on the bank of the river, and
under the beetling brow of Craig-er-esk.&nbsp; The river is seen
for a considerable distance struggling through a region of rocks,
which in some places rise in large masses above its surface, and
in others appear through the transparency of the stream shelving
to a considerable depth; wearing <a name="page171"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>throughout the odd appearance of a
vast assemblage of cubes, variously heaped, but with one face
constantly horizontal: at length the river breaks over a compact
strata; yet only in a fall of eight or ten feet, which is divided
into several streams.&nbsp; The white foam of the river, and the
light grey tint of the rocks, afford a strong contrast to the
mixed verdure and dark shadows of its banks; but upon the whole
the subject is rather to be noticed for its singularity than for
any leading points of picturesque beauty.&nbsp; More agreeably
composed appeared to us the other cascade of the tributary river
Rhayder, about two miles distant from the bridge.&nbsp; The dark
rocks that occasion the fall; the surrounding craigs; the light
and pendant foliage that adorns them, and the vigorous trees that
emerge from the banks, are all disposed with the utmost symmetry,
and form a highly-pleasing picture, though of inconsiderable
dimensions.</p>

<p>From Pont-y-pridd we made another excursion toward
Merthyr-tidvill; less to witness the lately-acquired importance
of the town in consequence of the great iron-works established in
its neighbourhood, than to trace the beauties of the Taffe
through its romantic valley.&nbsp; At one time, a towering hill
completely mantled with wood lifted its shaggy summit to the
clouds; in succession, naked rocks perpendicularly descended to
the water; or, through favoured hollows, a stripe of green meadow
would gently slope and mix its verdure with the stream.&nbsp; As
we <a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>advanced, the narrow valley still further contracted,
and the river, confined by the approaching bases of the
mountains, assumed the character of a torrent.&nbsp; Our road
continued on one margin of the river, and a canal, singularly
abounding with locks, kept pace with us on the other; to the
Cyclopean region of Merthyr-tidvill. <a name="citation173"></a><a

enter the town, but re-measured our steps to Pont-y-pridd; and

the town and castle of Caerphilly.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>The celebrated ruin of <span class="smcap">Caerphilly
Castle</span> soon appeared at some distance beneath us,
occupying the centre of a small plain, which, with its
surrounding amphitheatre of hills, presented a display of regular
fences and cultivation that strikingly contrasted with the
district that we had just left.&nbsp; The idea formed on a first
view of this stupendous pile is rather that of a ruined town than
a castle: <a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>it is by much the largest ruin in Britain, although its
dimensions are somewhat inferior to those of Windsor
castle.&nbsp; The high outer rampart, with its massive abutments
and frequent towers, still in a great measure entire, conveys at
once a clear impression of the great extent of the
fortress.&nbsp; In entering upon an examination of the ruin we
passed the barbican, <a name="citation174"></a><a
href="#footnote174" class="citation">[174]</a> now built up into
habitations; and, proceeding between two dilapidated towers,
entered the great area of the castle:&mdash;a range of building,
beneath the rampart on our right, once formed the barracks of the
garrison.&nbsp; We then advanced to that pile of superior
building, <i>i.e.</i> of citadel, hall, chapel, state and other
apartments, which is generally considered as the castle, in
distinction from the encircling area and its wall: clambering
over the fragments of another drawbridge and its defending
towers, we entered the first court, which appears to have
comprised the citadel: thence we passed through a large gateway,
with several grooves for portcullises, to the principal court of
the Castle.&nbsp; The area of this court is seventy yards <a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>by forty:
on the south side is that princely apartment, by some considered
the hall, and by others the chapel: but, whichever it may have
been, vestiges of much original beauty appear in the elegant
outline of its four large windows; the grand proportions of the
chimney-piece, and the light triplet pillars, with arches that go
round the room.&nbsp; The appearance of mortice holes in the
walls for the ends of beams, at the height of about the middle of
the windows, led Camden to suppose that the cieling was projected
from thence, and that an apartment above was lighted by the upper
portion of the windows; but surely at a time when symmetry in
building was so well cultivated, and where it appears to have
been so successfully applied, such a ridiculous contrivance could
not have taken place: more probably, as I conceive, from those
mortices a support was derived for a lofty arched roof, or a
gallery. <a name="citation175"></a><a href="#footnote175"
class="citation">[175]</a>&nbsp; Eastward of the hall, is the
curiosity of a leaning tower, a bulky fragment of the ruin
between seventy and eighty feet <a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>in height, whose walls are of a
prodigious thickness: it hangs nearly eleven feet out of the
perpendicular, and is only held together by the strength of its
cement.&nbsp; How or when this phenomenon happened no legend
informs us; but it has remained in this state many
centuries.&nbsp; As the adjoining towers, and all the standing
parts of the ruin, remain perpendicular, the cause must have
arisen from a local failure of the foundation: hence I am of
opinion, that a solution of the phenomenon may be found in the
effects of a mine, and which probably took place during the long
siege which Hugh le Despenser sustained in this castle in the
time of Edward the Second.&nbsp; Near this part of the ruin a
place is shewn as the mint, with two furnaces for melting
metal.&nbsp; From this chamber we ascended a spiral staircase to
the corridor, still in very good preservation, which, lighted by
small windows, and passing round the principal court, formed a
communication with the different apartments.&nbsp; The external
view of the western entrance of the ruin, with its ponderous
circular towers venerably shaded with ivy, is remarkably
striking; and, with the remains of its drawbridge and defending
outwork, may be considered <a name="page177"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 177</span>as the most entire part of the
ruin.&nbsp; An artificial mound some distance off, but within the
works of the castle, was most likely used for exploratory
purposes.</p>
<p>From the great plan of this castle, and there being no direct
evidence to the contrary, its foundation has been attributed to
the Romans; and some ingenious arguments have been adduced to
prove, that it was their Bullaum Silurum.&nbsp; But it
sufficiently appears, that no considerable part of the present
fortress was built by them, as the predatory army of Rhys Tycan
took and rased Caerphilly castle in 1221.&nbsp; The best
supported opinion is that of the Hon. Daines Barrington, who
attributes the present erection to Edward the
First.&mdash;Caerphilly has lately increased from an obscure
village to a well-built little town; and the respectable
appearance of its two inns may be in a great measure dated from
the great increase of the visitants of the castle. <a
name="citation177"></a><a href="#footnote177"
class="citation">[177]</a></p>
<p><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>We
left Caerphilly, over to hilly boundary, on the road to Cardiff;
where we noticed the singular appearance of some peasants digging
coals from the surface of the ground.&nbsp; At the extremity of
this tract, Thornhill, a grand elevation, afforded us a most
extensive prospect, which, illuminated by an evening sun, formed
a picture of uncommon brilliancy.&nbsp; The wide plain of Cardiff
displayed for many miles, in every direction, a gratifying extent
of Nature&rsquo;s bounty, in an endless variety of cultivation,
chequered with numberless hedgerows, and enlivened by several
villages, whose neatly whitened walls glistened through their
appendant foliage: the rich verdure was in one part varied by the
russet hue of an extensive warren.&nbsp; At the extremity of this
tract appeared the expansive Severn, in which the two islands of
the steep and flat Holmes were conspicuous; and afar off the bold
hills of Somersetshire closed the prospect.&nbsp; We slowly
descended from the spot commanding this range of objects, and <a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>travelled
on a good road towards Cardiff, with the episcopal ruins of
Landaff at a small distance on our right.</p>
<p>On entering <span class="smcap">Cardiff</span>, the capital of
Glamorganshire, between the ivy-mantled walls of its castle, and
the mouldering ruin of a house of White Friars, we were much
pleased with the aspect of the town: nor were we less so on a
closer examination of its neat well-paved streets; it appearing
to us one of the cleanest and most agreeable towns in
Wales.&nbsp; The high tower of its church, crowned with four
transparent Gothic pinnacles, had long engaged our interest; but
on a near view we did not find the body of the church to
correspond with it; it being of an older date, a plain Norman
structure.&nbsp; This, I believe, was the conventual church of
the Franciscan Friars that are described as having occupied the
eastern suburb of the town.&nbsp; The other parish church, for
Cardiff is divided into two parishes, was undermined by the
action of the river, about a century and a half since, and fell
down.&nbsp; The house of the White Friars has been already
noticed; and without the west gate stood a monastery of Black
Friars.&nbsp; This town was formerly <a name="page180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>encompassed by a wall, and vestiges
of its four gates yet remain.&nbsp; Cardiff, having the benefit
of a good harbour, carries on a brisk trade with Bristol, and
other places, and has of late considerably increased its
commercial importance: but perhaps its chief interest with
tourists will be derived from its castle.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Cardiff Castle</span>, a seat of the
Marquis of Bute, (Baron Cardiff and Earl of Windsor), was until
lately a Gothic structure of considerable elegance; but having
undergone a repair, without attention to the antique style of
architecture, it presents a motley combination, in which the
remaining Gothic but serves to excite our regret for the greater
portion destroyed.&nbsp; The misguided direction of this work is
prominently conspicuous in the enlargement of the building,
wherein fashionable square windows appear throughout the lower
apartments, while the original character of the edifice is
imitated in the Gothic lines of the upper windows: a strange
violation of common propriety, to raise an antique superstructure
upon a modern foundation!&nbsp; The part of the castle which is
kept up is a single range of building; and an elegant
machicolated tower, overlooking the whole, still <a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>frowns
defiance on the petty innovations beneath.&nbsp; The internal has
been entirely new-planned, and a number of portraits of the
present lord&rsquo;s progenitors are ranged in the apartments,
with the principal events of their lives, emblazoned in letters
of gold; but they are for the most part indifferently
executed.&nbsp; In front of the building is a spacious lawn, from
the trim surface of which rises an artificial mound, bearing the
mouldering ruin of the ancient keep, <a name="citation181"></a><a
href="#footnote181" class="citation">[181]</a> carefully shorn of
shrub and briar.&nbsp; In the tower, at the entrance, a dark damp
dungeon is described to have been the prison of Robert duke of
Normandy; in which he was confined near thirty years, after being
deprived of his sight and inheritance by his younger brother
Henry the First.&nbsp; But it is more probable that he had the
whole range of the castle; for, independent of the improbability
that any human creature could live so long in such a place, we
have the authority of Odo Vitalis and William of Malmesbury, that
Henry made his imprisonment as easy as possible; furnishing him
with an elegant table, and buffoons to divert him.&nbsp; <a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>A high
rampart incloses the whole; round the top of which a walk is
carried, affording many pleasing views of the surrounding
country.</p>
<p>When Robert Fitzhammon conquered and divided the lordship of
Glamorgan with his twelve knights, he reserved the town of
Cardiff, among other estates, for himself, and erected this
castle: here he held his courts of Chancery and Exchequer; the
former on the first Monday in every month, when his knights or
their heirs were bound to attend, and were then entitled to
apartments in the outer court of the castle; which privilege,
says Sir John Price, their heirs or assigns enjoy to this
day.</p>
<p>This castle has frequently experienced the vicissitudes of
war.&nbsp; Soon after its erection, one Ivor Black, a little
resolute Welchman, marched hither privately, with a troop of
mountaineers, and surprised the castle in the night; carrying off
William Earl of Gloucester (Fitzhammon&rsquo;s grandson),
together with his wife and son; whom he detained prisoners until
he obtained satisfaction for some injuries that he had
suffered.&nbsp; It was also taken by Maelgon and Rhys gyre anno
1282; <a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>and again by the parliamentary forces in the civil
wars, after a long siege.</p>
<p>A pleasant walk over the fields led us to the episcopal city
of <span class="smcap">Landaff</span>, now in extent an
inconsiderable village: this deserted spot occupies a gentle
eminence in the great plain of Cardiff.&nbsp; The west front of
the cathedral is an admirable relic of Norman architecture, with
two elegant towers of extraordinary height, profusely enriched
with the best sculpture of that age: here all the apertures are
circularly arched; but the windows of part of the nave, yet
remaining, are Gothic.&nbsp; Upon the chancel&rsquo;s falling to
decay some score years since, a great sum was expended in raising
the present church upon the old stock; but surely such an absence
of taste and common sense was never before instanced: beneath the
solemn towers has sprung up a fantastic summer-house elevation,
with a Venetian window, Ionic pilasters, and flower-pot jars upon
the parapet.&nbsp; The same sort of window is coupled with the
elegant line of the ornamented Gothic in other parts of the
structure; and within, a huge building upon the model of a
heathen temple surrounds the altar; which, with two thrones,
darken and fill up <a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>nearly half the church.&nbsp; From this mass of
inconsistencies we turned to the inspection of several ancient
monuments, which were chiefly recumbent, and from several marks
of recent damage appeared to be much neglected. <a
name="citation184a"></a><a href="#footnote184a"
class="citation">[184a]</a></p>
<p>The cathedral, now in ruins, was built by Bishop Urban, anno
1120, upon the site of pile founded by St. Dubritius in the
commencement of the sixth century, and dedicated to more saints
than I have room to enumerate.&nbsp; Urban also built a palace
here, which was destroyed by Owen Glendower: its high outer walls
and gateway, however, remain, and form an inclosure to a
garden.&nbsp; A large mansion adjoining, occupied by Mr.
Matthews, is, I understand, attached to the bishopric. <a

<p>On quitting Cardiff, we soon entered <span
class="smcap">Monmouthshire</span> <a name="citation185"></a><a
href="#footnote185" class="citation">[185]</a> in crossing Rumney
bridge.&nbsp; The church of Rumney is a large Gothic <a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>edifice,
with an embattled tower.&nbsp; Nearly opposite to it, on the left
of the road, crowning a steep bank of the river, is an old
encampment of an irregular figure, with a triangular outwork; and
a short distance further, at Pen-y-pile, another occurs of a
polyhedrous form.&nbsp; As we proceeded, the elevated mansion and
extensive woods of <span class="smcap">Ruperah</span>, an elegant
seat belonging to a branch of the Morgan family, appeared finely
situated beneath the brow of some hills bordering the vale of
Caerphilly; and on a gentle hill below it, <span
class="smcap">Keven-Mable</span>, an ancient seat of the
Kemy&rsquo;s family.&nbsp; At the rural little <a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>village of
St. Mellons, the old and new roads to Newport unite: we took the
latter, which is the lowermost and nearest, traced on a range of
gentle eminences skirting Wentloog level, an extensive fertile
plain won from the sea.&nbsp; This wide flat, extending from the
Rumney to the Usk rivers, is relieved by the intersections of
hedges and drains, and has a sprinkling of white cottages; among
which the towers of St. Bride&rsquo;s, Marshfield, and Peterson
churches rise conspicuously.&nbsp; Our route passed through
Castleton, where there was formerly a castle; of which, however,
only a small artificial mount, the site of its citadel, now
inclosed in the garden of Mr. Phillips, and a chapel converted
into a barn, remain.&nbsp; Gwern-y-cleppa park, the next object
of our attention on the road, contains a ruin nearly hidden in an
interwoven thicket, once the mansion of Ivor-hael (the generous),
the pride of bardish song, who flourished in the commencement of
the fourteenth century.</p>
<p>We entered <span class="smcap">Tredegar Park</span> in
succession, a very ancient seat of the Morgan family.&nbsp; This
park is laid out in the obsolete style of groves and avenues; but
possesses great room <a name="page188"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 188</span>for modern taste, in the variety of
swell and hollow composing its surface, the remarkable size and
beauty of the oaks and Spanish chesnuts with which it is
decorated, and the picturesque course of the rapid Ebwy, whose
red rocky banks form a striking contrast to the surrounding
verdure.&nbsp; The turnpike road passes through the park, and
within a few hundred yards of the mansion, a huge quadrangular
brick building, of the date of Charles the Second&rsquo;s reign,
with a high shelving roof, in which are two or three tiers of
windows, similar to the weighing-house at Amsterdam.&nbsp;
Internally, the house is convenient and well arranged, with state
and domestic apartments, several of which are preserved in their
original character.&nbsp; The most remarkable is the oak room;
the flooring of which, forty-two feet by twenty-seven, was
furnished by a single oak; and the wainscoting, formed of the
same material, is much admired for its antique carving.&nbsp; A
large collection of pictures, chiefly family portraits, is
distributed through the house; but few of them are valuable as
specimens of art.&nbsp; Among the extensive offices are several
remains of the ancient castellated mansion, <a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>described
by Leland as &ldquo;a very fair place of stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Morgan family being one of the most ancient and
considerable in Wales, the ingenuity of the bards has been
excited to trace its origin: some have venally derived it from
Cam the second son of Noah; but others refute this position, and
modestly carry it no further than his third son.&nbsp; Without
noticing several intervening personages contended to be the
founders of this family, Cadivor the great, lord of Dyfed, who
died anno 1084, appears to be the only one well supported in the
appointment of its great ancestor.</p>
<p>From Tredegar Park we immediately crossed the Ebwy by a long
narrow bridge, and presently entered <span
class="smcap">Newport</span>, a dirty ill-built town nearly
comprized in one long street winding down a bank of the river
Usk.&nbsp; The eminence on which its church is situated, at the
upper part of the town, affords a very fine prospect of the
surrounding country; at the extremity of the town appears its
ruined castle, watered by the silvery Usk: an intermixture of
wood and pasture clothes the surrounding hills and valleys: the
wild mountains about Pont-y-pool are strongly contrasted <a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>by the
fertile tract of Wentloog and Caldecot levels, and the noble
expanse of the Bristol channel backed by the cultivated hills of
Somersetshire.&nbsp; The church exhibits the architecture of
several ages: its nave comprehends the original church, which is
of the oldest mode of building, and may be considered as of a
date prior to the settlement of the Normans: the chancel and
ailes are of later architecture.&nbsp; The western doorway,
connected with the ancient chapel of St. Mary, now converted into
a burying-place, and which was formerly the grand entrance,
exhibits a curious specimen of Saxon carving, in a circular
archway, with hatched and indented mouldings resting on low
columns with capitals of rude foliage.&nbsp; The church contains
three ancient monuments; but its chief ornament is the high
square embattled towers built by Henry the Third, in gratitude
for the attachment of the townsmen to his cause during his
contest with the barons.&nbsp; St. Wooloo, the patron of this
spot, is held in high veneration by the natives.&nbsp; He retired
from the pride and pageantry of kinghood, to lead a life of
prayer and mortification: a lowly cottage was his dwelling;
sackcloth <a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>his apparel; he lived by the labour of his hands; the
crystal rill afforded his only beverage, and barley bread,
rendered more disrelishing by a sprinkling of ashes, his constant
food.&nbsp; He left this world for better fare in the next about
the end of the fifth century.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Newport Castle</span> is a ruin of very
inconsiderable dimensions: its quadrangular area was only
defended by a simple wall, except on the side next the river,
where three towers still remain in a nearly intire state.&nbsp;
There is an octagon tower at each extremity of this side; a large
square one between them, with turrets at each angle, appears to
have been the citadel, and contains a vaulted apartment called
the state-room; at the bottom of this tower a handsome Gothic
arch forms a water-gate, which has within it the groove of a
portcullis: between this and the further tower was the baronial
hall, the ruins of which yet remain.&nbsp; The pointed arches
throughout this building testify it to have been a work posterior
to the Norman era; though it is certain, that there was a castle
at Newport in 1173, when Owen ap Caradoc, going to treat with
king Henry without arms or attendants, <a
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>was basely
murdered by the soldiers of Newport castle.&nbsp; Jowerth ap
Owen, his father, in revenge for this treachery, carried fire and
sword to the gates of Hereford and Gloucester.&nbsp; Newport was
formerly encompassed with a wall; but of this there are no
remains; nor of the three gates mentioned by Leland, except some
small vestiges of the one next the bridge.&nbsp; A large Gothic
building near the castle, with a stone coat of arms over the
door, now occupied as a warehouse, was formerly the
murringer&rsquo;s <a name="citation192"></a><a
href="#footnote192" class="citation">[192]</a> house.&nbsp; In
place of an inconvenient wooden bridge, a handsome stone one of
five arches has been lately executed by Mr. David Edward, son of
the mason of Pont-y-pridd: a canal was also just finished at the
time of our visit, reaching from Pont-y-pool, by means of which
its brisk and improving trade in coals and iron is much
facilitated.</p>
<p>On the banks of the river, a short distance below the bridge,
are the remains of a house of preaching friars; consisting of the
spacious refectory, part of the church, and other buildings, now
converted to private uses.&mdash;<a name="page193"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 193</span>About a mile further southward, near
the conflux of the Usk and Ebwy, are the small vestiges of Green
castle, once a considerable fortress belonging to the duke of
Lancaster, and described by Churchyard, who flourished in the
reign of Elizabeth, as</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A goodly seate, a tower, a princely
pyle.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We made an excursion on the road to Caerphilly, which embraces
several objects not unworthy of notice.&nbsp; About a mile and
half from Newport is the Gaer, a large encampment supposed to be
Roman, occupying the brow of an eminence near the Ebwy in
Tredegar park.&nbsp; A short distance further is the little
village of <span class="smcap">Bassaleg</span>, the approach to
which is very picturesque; where the Ebwy appears struggling in
its bed of red rocks, and throwing its clear stream over a weir
just beneath the bridge: above it rises the church, with its
embattled tower finely relieved by intervening foliage.&nbsp;
Here, according to Tanner, was a Benedictine priory, a cell to
the abbey of Glastonbury; but of this no traces are evident;
unless a ruin in the deep recesses of a forest about a mile
westward, called Coed-y-Monachty, or the wood of <a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>the
monastery, are its remains.&nbsp; On the summit of a hill
overgrown with coppice, about a mile from Bassaleg, near the road
to Llanvihangel, is a circular encampment called
Craeg-y-saesson.</p>
<p>From Bassaleg the country continues undulating and fertile, to
the vale of Machen, where the Rumney emerges from among wild
hills and overhanging forests, and sweeps through the plain: a
sprinkling of white cottages enliven the scene, which receives an
additional effect from its picturesque church, and the steep
acclivity of Machen hill, studded all over with lime-kilns.&nbsp;
At the opening of the vale is <span
class="smcap">Machen-place</span>, once a respectable seat of the
Morgans, but now tottering in decay, and occupied as a
farm-house: some memorials of faded grandeur may here be traced
in a circular apartment, with a rich stuccoed cieling, called the
hunting-room.&nbsp; A pair of andirons weighing two hundred
weight, formerly employed in roasting an entire ox, and an
immense oak table, may also convey an idea of the solid fare and
plenty of days of yore.&nbsp; We pursued the road no further;
but, returning <a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>through Newport <a name="citation195"></a><a
href="#footnote195" class="citation">[195]</a>, and crossing its
bridge, took the road to Caerleon.</p>
<p>Our route soon became uninteresting, and continued a confined
and miry avenue: until, arriving at <span
class="smcap">Church-church</span>, and looking over a hedge
opposite to it, when a prospect burst upon us with an electric
suddenness, grandly extensive and delightful.&nbsp; From the
foreground descended a succession of bold knolls or gentle
swells, clothed with ornamental plantations, in a wide display of
sylvan beauty, to Caldecot level, whose uniform though fruitful
plain was in a great measure concealed by the intervention of
contrasting heights.&nbsp; Beyond this, the majestic
Severn&rsquo;s</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&mdash;fresh current flow&rsquo;d<br />
Against the eastern ray translucent, pure,<br />
With touch &aelig;thereal of Heaven&rsquo;s fiery rod.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Numerous barks diversified its surface; and a large fleet of
ships, anchored at King&rsquo;s-road, became a striking
object.&nbsp; The high opposite <a name="page196"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 196</span>shores of Somersetshire either
descended in fertile slopes, laid out in pastures and cornfields;
or, abruptly disjoined, opposed their cliffs, a naked surface of
rock, to the waves.&nbsp; Eastward, over Gloucestershire and the
neighbouring counties, such a variety of hills and valleys,
verdant lawns and waving woods, embowered hamlets and handsome
villas appeared, that the eye was at a loss where to rest for
pre-eminent beauty.&nbsp; Light clouds floated in the atmosphere;
and the sun, &ldquo;sparing of light,&rdquo; distributed its rays
in partial streaks; but the varied illumination rather heightened
than diminished the charms of the picture.&nbsp; We turned from
this assemblage of nature&rsquo;s wealth, this delightful
landscape, with regret, and descended among the adjoining
plantations of Sir Robert Salusbury, Messrs. Sykes, Kemeys, and
Philips, towards Caldecot level; a large tract of land, similar
to that of Wentloog, rescued from the inroads of the sea by human
industry.&nbsp; Near the western extremity of this plain rises
the peninsulated promontory of <span class="smcap">Gold
Cliff</span>, so called from a glittering yellow mica
incorporated with the rock, and which is even now considered by
the peasants as indicating <a name="page197"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 197</span>a gold mine.&nbsp; The brow of the
cliff was formerly dignified with an opulent priory, founded by
Robert de Chandos anno 1113: its small remains are incorporated
into a barn, and other buildings of a farm-house.</p>
<p>Returning, we took a hasty view of Christchurch, an ordinary
building chiefly Gothic; but a Saxon arch reposing on low
columns, which forms the entrance, indicates that the greater
part of the present structure is engrafted upon an older
foundation.&nbsp; Within, a Gothic screen of exquisite
workmanship, separating the chancel from the nave, was formerly
much admired; but it is now shamefully injured.&nbsp; A curious
sepulchral monument here is deemed miraculous, on the eve of the
circumcision, in curing sick children.&nbsp; Formerly the tomb
was crowded with the little subjects of credulity, who were bound
to remain in contact with the stone during the night; but, the
natural agency of a warm bed being found more favourable to
convalescence than the miraculous interposition, the fees of the
sexton have of late considerably diminished.&nbsp; The public
house near the church was the ancient manse.</p>
<p><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>A
descent of alarming steepness led us toward the ancient town of
<span class="smcap">Caerleon</span>, through its suburb, a long
narrow village, still bearing the classical appellation of Ultra
Pontem.&nbsp; We crossed the Usk by a narrow wooden bridge with a
flooring of loose planks, and immediately entered the town, the
Isca Silurum of Antoninus, the station of the second legion, and
the principal Roman own in the country of the Silures, now so far
diminished as scarcely to occupy one sixth of the area within are
Roman walls.&nbsp; It was, however, in a declining state so far
back as the fourteenth century, as appears from the following
account given by Giraldus: &ldquo;Many remains of its former
magnificence are still visible.&nbsp; Splendid palaces, which
once emulated with their gilded roofs the grandeur of Rome; for
it was originally built by the Roman graces, and adorned with
stately edifices.&nbsp; A gigantic tower; numerous baths; ruins
of a temple and a theatre, the walls of which are partly
standing.&nbsp; Here we still see, both within and without the
walls, subterraneous buildings, aqueducts, and vaulted caverns,
and stoves so <a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
199</span>excellently contrived as to convey their heat through
secret and imperceptible pores.&rdquo;&nbsp; This description has
been followed in a compiled Tour published not long since, and,
by an unfortunate mistake, given as its present appearance.&nbsp;
Alas! it exhibits a melancholy reverse:</p>
<blockquote><p>The cloud-capt towers,<br />
The gorgeous palaces,<br />
The solemn temples,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>are dissolved: the town is a poor straggling place; and
vestiges of its former magnificence must be curiously sought
after to be seen at all.&nbsp; Statues, altars, columns, elegant
freizes, sarcophagi, coins and intaglios, have been making their
appearance during several ages; but they are immediately carried
away by curious persons, or more frequently applied to domestic
uses.&nbsp; An altar with a Roman inscription had been dug up
just before our arrival, and we were conducted by an obliging
gentleman of the town to the garden in which it was found: where
we saw the venerable monument of antiquity just finished slicing
into half a dozen slabs for paving.</p>
<p><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>The
Roman fortification forms an oblong square, with the corners a
little rounded, <a name="citation200a"></a><a
href="#footnote200a" class="citation">[200a]</a> and unfurnished
with towers.&nbsp; Many fragments of the walls accompanied by the
fosse are evident; deprived of the facing-stones, they appear in
great masses of grout-work; <i>i.e.</i> of stones, broken tiles,
and bricks promiscuously bedded in cement.&nbsp; The remains are
no where more than fourteen feet high, which is much less than
their original elevation, and ten or twelve in thickness.&nbsp;
Their circumference does not exceed 1800 yards; but the adjacent
fields are continually yielding up foundations, &amp;c. which
denote the suburbs to have been very extensive; tradition,
indeed, reports them to have been nine miles round.&nbsp; The
castle stood between the walls and the river, of which some small
vestiges appear at the Hanbury Arms. <a
name="citation200b"></a><a href="#footnote200b"
class="citation">[200b]</a>&nbsp; At a little distance from this
place, on the opposite side of the road, we noticed a high
artificial mound about 300 yards in circumference, which is <a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>the site of
the citadel described by Giraldus as gigantic.&nbsp; The small
remains of its walls appear to consist of solid masonry; but this
part of the fortification is, no doubt, posterior to the rest,
and was most likely erected by the Normans.</p>
<p>The house of Miss Morgan, formerly a Cistercian abbey, has
been entirely new-faced with squared stones collected from the
ruins of Caerleon, as have also many others in the town.&nbsp;
This lady has collected several Roman coins, and has other
curiosities in her possession that we would gladly have examined,
and were offered an introduction for that purpose; but our
way-worn apparel (a false shame, if the reader insist upon it)
was an obstacle in our way of accepting it.&nbsp; Other Roman
vestiges appear in the market-house of Caerleon, which is
supported by four massive Tuscan pillars.&nbsp; Immediately
without the town, and adjoining Miss Morgan&rsquo;s premises, is
the Roman amphitheatre, commonly called Arthur&rsquo;s round
table.&nbsp; It is an oval concavity, seventy-four yards by
sixty-four, and six deep; in which are ranges of stone seats,
though now covered with earth and verdure.&nbsp; The foundation
of its encircling <a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>walls was met with on digging in the year 1706, when a
statue of Diana and two ornamental pedestals were also
discovered.</p>
<p>In the neighbourhood of Caerleon are several encampments that
were probably used for airing the troops in summer.&nbsp; The
most remarkable are, that of the Lodge, occupying a hill in the
park of Lantarnam, about a mile north-west of Caerleon; the one
of Penros, a short distance to the left of the road to Usk; that
at Mayndee, near Christ-church; and a fourth in the wood of St.
Julian&rsquo;s, towards Newport.&nbsp; Near the latter spot a
chapel of high antiquity, dedicated to St. Julius; is now used as
a barn.&nbsp; But St. Julian&rsquo;s is more remarkable for a
Gothic mansion, once the residence of the ingenious, valiant, and
vain lord Herbert of Cherbury.</p>
<p>Edward, first lord Herbert of Cherbury, was born anno 1581:
his infancy was remarkable for mental and bodily weakness; but he
soon became distinguished as a scholar and a valiant
knight.&nbsp; Most of the living languages and every elegant
accomplishment engaged his study.&nbsp; We learn from the history
of his life; written by himself (in which he is considered to be
the most chivalrous, <a name="page203"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 203</span>learned, handsome, discerning, and
wonderful gentleman that ever figured in story); at fifteen he
took to himself a wife; and being a few years afterwards
presented at court; his love-inspiring attractions excited the
rusty passions of Elizabeth, then seventy years of
age.&mdash;&ldquo;The queen,&rdquo; says the noble biographer,
&ldquo;looked attentively upon me, and <i>swearing her ordinary
oath</i>, said, &ldquo;It is pity he was married so young,&rdquo;
and thereupon have me her hand to kiss twice; both times gently
clapping me on the cheek.&rdquo;&nbsp; The consorts of Lewis the
Thirteenth and James the First were still more fascinated by this
mighty conqueror of hearts, who excited jealousy even in the
breast of royalty!&nbsp; Many enamoured dames of the court
wearing his picture in their bosoms brought him in hourly danger
of assassination from their enraged husbands: yet his miraculous
courage and address ensured victory in every encounter.&nbsp;
Among numerous excellencies that distinguished his clay from the
common material of mortality, the noble lord declares, &ldquo;it
is well known to them that wait in my chamber, that the shirts,
waistcoats, and other garments I wear next <a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>my body,
are sweet beyond what either can be believed or hath been
observed in any body else; which sweetness was also found to be
in my breath before I used to take tobacco.&rdquo;&nbsp; With all
this extravagance, which may be set to the account of old age,
often vain and garrulous, Lord Herbert may be justly considered
one of the first characters of the age and country in which he
lived.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lantarnam</span> house and park, situated
about a mile and a half from Caerleon, near the road from Newport
to Pont-y-pool, occupy the site of a rich Cistercian abbey.&nbsp;
The mansion is a neglected gloomy structure, which appears to
have been erected about the reign of Elizabeth, and chiefly out
of the materials of the abbey.&nbsp; A large Gothic gateway and
the monks cells, now converted into stabling, are vestiges of the
parent building.</p>
<p>The accounts that we had collected of Pont-y-pool did not
incline us to abandon the line of our tour to visit it.&nbsp; The
town, sufficiently large and populous, yet blackened by
neighbouring coal and iron works, and situated in a dreary region
only rich in mineral treasure, would hardly prove interesting but
<a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>to those
concerned in its traffic.&nbsp; Its first consequence arose from
a manufacture of japanned ware invented in the time of Charles
the Second, which remained a long time peculiar to the town, but
is now generally understood.&nbsp; In its immediate vicinity
Pont-y-pool Park, the seat of Hanbury Leigh, Esq. forms a
conspicuous ornament, and is described by Mr. Coxe as possessing
a good collection of pictures.</p>
<p>Our road from Caerleon to Usk, leaving the house and
encampment of Penros on the left, led up an ascent from which we
had an interesting view of the surrounding district: A narrow
valley winds round the base of the eminence watered by the
Usk.&nbsp; The opposite boundary of the valley sustained the
woods of Kemey&rsquo;s and Bertholly; and in the contrary
direction the eye ranges over the venerable groves of Lantarnam,
and a wavy intervening country to the distant mountains near
Abergavenny.&nbsp; Within two miles of Usk we entered <span
class="smcap">Langibby</span>, a small village, only to be
noticed for an ancient mansion of the Williams&rsquo;s family
near it.&nbsp; This structure, attributed to the erection of
Inigo Jones, contains no distinguishing points <a
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>of
architecture; but the house and grounds command delightful views,
which receive no inconsiderable interest from the local
possession of a majestic ruin.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Langibby
Castle</span> rears its mouldering battlements on the brow of a
bold hill, completely overspread with wood.&nbsp; We have no
certain accounts when this castle was built; but the pointed
arches that occur throughout the ruin denote its erection to have
been posterior to the first settlement of the Normans in these
parts.&nbsp; It formerly belonged to the Clares Earls of
Gloucester; but has been upwards of two centuries in the family
of the present possessor.&nbsp; Of this line was Sir Trevor
Williams, a zealous supporter of the parliamentary cause in the
civil wars, when Langibby castle was spoken of by Cromwell as a
fortress of strength and importance.</p>
<p>Our approach to Usk was traced through its vale on a bank of
the river, and beneath a high hill entirely shaded with wood:
close to our left appeared the whitened Gothic church of
Lanbadock: but the handsome bridge of Usk, the antique town and
ivy-mantled castle, formed more interesting objects in successive
distances; while, afar off, <a name="page207"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 207</span>the varied line of the mountains
near Abergavenny, the craggy summit of the Skyridd, and the
abrupt cone of the Sugar-loaf, contrasting the lofty even swell
of the Blorenge, presented a terminating line of the most
picturesque description.&nbsp; This distance alone was illumined
by the sun; for the evening drew to a close, and all our home
view was wrapt in one grand shadow.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">USK CASTLE AND CHURCH&mdash;EXCURSION TO
RAGLAN&mdash;ELEGANT RUINS OF RAGLAN CASTLE&mdash;VIEWS FROM THE
DEVAUDON&mdash;ROMAN ANTIQUITIES AT CAERWENT&mdash;TESSELATED
PAVEMENT.</p>
<p>Usk, supposed to be the Burrium of the Romans, occupies a flat
situation on the banks of its river.&nbsp; Though now a small
place, in great part untenanted and falling to ruin, <a
name="citation208"></a><a href="#footnote208"
class="citation">[208]</a> it was formerly of very considerable
extent.&nbsp; The form and dimensions of its ancient boundary may
be traced in an imperfect rampart among the adjoining fields and
orchards.&nbsp; The figure is not oblong, as most Roman works of
the kind were, but irregularly rectilinear.&nbsp; On a gentle
eminence in the northern <a name="page209"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 209</span>precinct of the town is the castle,
famous in history for withstanding many a fierce assault; but the
ruin has little picturesque attraction: such parts as are not
converted to the domestic purposes of a farm-yard are so
enveloped in ivy, as scarcely to afford a characterizing form
externally.&nbsp; We entered the castle through a Gothic gateway:
vestiges of the baronial hall appear on the east side; and some
of the towers, with round arched apertures, seem of the earliest
construction: but we have no certain accounts when the castle was
founded.</p>
<p>Not far from the castle is the church, still a large
structure, though much contracted from its original extent.&nbsp;
The tower, in which circular arches are introduced, is the oldest
part of the edifice; the body of the church is Gothic.&nbsp; This
church belonged to a Benedictine priory of five nuns; and part of
the priory-house is now standing, a little southward of the
Church, in the occupation of a farmer.&nbsp; The common prison, a
Gothic building near the bridge, was formerly a Roman Catholic
chapel. <a name="citation209"></a><a href="#footnote209"
class="citation">[209]</a></p>
<p><a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>There
are several ancient encampments in the neighbourhood of
Usk.&nbsp; That of Craeg-y-garcyd, crowning a woody precipice on
the west side of the river, about a mile above the town, is
supposed by Harris to be Roman.&nbsp; Its figure is very
irregular, and remarkable for seven very large tumuli within the
rampart.&nbsp; About two miles from Usk, in our way to Raglan, we
passed Campwood on our left, <a name="page211"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 211</span>another encampment, of art oval
figure, entirely covered with wood, but not remarkable either in
its situation or construction.</p>
<p>Our ride to Raglan traversed a bold undulating country of
uncommon richness, where the luxuriance of the soil was alike
conspicuous in impervious woods or teeming orchards sweeping over
the hills, and verdant meadows sweetly carpeting the vallies.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When morn, her rosy steps in th&rsquo;
eastern clime<br />
Advancing, sow&rsquo;d the earth with orient pearl,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>we began our journey; and this range of fertility but
disclosed itself in partial gleams through the exhaling dew, as
we ascended a hill from Usk.&nbsp; Advancing, the mists
disappeared, and we quickly found ourselves in a sequestered
valley, whose high encircling hills were variously decorated with
a profusion of wood: the morning sun brilliantly shone on the
dewy verdure; and we were admiring the charming scenery, while
our spirits partook of its cheerfulness, when a huntsman&rsquo;s
horn resounded from a neighbouring thicket, and echoed through
the hills: a deep-mouthed pack, joining in full chorus, announced
a <i>throwing-off</i>.&nbsp; The concert continued, <a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>though the
performers remained unseen as we anxiously skirted the dale; but
our road soon took an ascent, in the precise direction of the
hunt; and, gaining an eminence, a new vale and its accompanyments
opened to us, yet without the hunting party.&nbsp; However, we
had not long gazed in disappointment when, from the dark umbrage
of a thick wood, the hounds rushed forward like a wave over the
meadows; the men and horses were not far behind; but, scouring a
descent that would have scared a lowland sportsman, pursued the
game, which continued out of sight.&nbsp; But at length we saw
Reynard skulk from a ditchy fence in a field before us, and dash
across the meadows: the hounds and hunters were close at his
heels.&nbsp; A loud shout from the party, a superior yell in the
dogs, and the strained exertions of the animal, proclaimed a
general view: we heartily joined in the halloo; and even our
sorry jades displayed unusual spirit; for they pricked up their
ears, and absolutely began a gallop to join in the chase; but a
gate near a yard high opposed an insurmountable obstacle to that
intention, and obliged us to remain inactive spectators while <a
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>the party
veered up a woody hill and finally disappeared from us.</p>
<p>Reluctantly parting from this animating scene, we entered the
little village of <span class="smcap">Raglan</span>; where an old
woman, knitting at the door of her cottage, proffered her service
to take care of our horses while we walked over a fallow field to
the superb ruins of <span class="smcap">Raglan Castle</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p213b.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>The approach led up a gentle eminence; but a screen of high
elms and thick underwood, issuing from the moat, intervened
between us and the castle, which remained concealed, until,
penetrating the thicket, a display of the ruin burst upon us,
elegantly beautiful!&nbsp; Sweetly picturesque!&nbsp; No
theatrical scene was ever designed in a happier taste, or
unfolded itself to admiring beholders with a more sudden and
impressive effect.&nbsp; In this <i>coup d&rsquo;&oelig;il</i>,
the Gothic portal and two elegant embattled towers immediately
arrested the eye.&nbsp; Of the polygonal towers that formerly
defended the entrance, one is completely hidden in a majestic
mantle of ivy, which descends in a profuse festoon over the
gateway.&nbsp; The other, admirably contrasting, and in a most
perfect state of preservation, <a name="page214"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 214</span>rears its beautiful machicolated
summit with scarcely any leafy incumbrance: yet a few tasteful
tufts of ivy sparingly issue from the windows and oillets of the
tower, and wave their elegant tendrils over the glistening polish
of the walls. <a name="citation214"></a><a href="#footnote214"
class="citation">[214]</a>&nbsp; Another tower of similar beauty,
but superior dimensions, appears a little further, at the eastern
angle of the structure.&nbsp; On the other side of the porch, the
ruins are concealed by a profuse pile of ivy; but some lofty
portions of the ruin start from the verdure with considerable
elegance; and two windows, standing one over the other, exhibit
an effect of ornamental relief in their freizes and mouldings
that would not discredit any age.</p>
<p>From this assemblage of beautiful objects we fixed our
attention on the massive citadel, placed rather obliquely in
front of the ornamented ruins.&nbsp; One half of this structure
was blown up by order of Cromwell, upon the <a
name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>taking of
the castle by Fairfax: from the remaining section it appears to
have been a hexagonal building of five stories, whose sides were
flanked by semicircular bastions covering each angle.&nbsp; The
citadel is surrounded by a moat and terrace, with a wall, in
which appear niches, once adorned with statues of the Roman
emperors.&nbsp; The rough and threatening aspect of these broken
walls, and the ponderous bulk of disjointed fragments, falling in
the same point of view with the gentle and decorative parts just
described, strongly contrast each other, and heighten the varied
character of the picture.</p>
<p>This charming <i>mor&ccedil;eau</i> was illumined by a morning
sun, which shone direct on the marble-like surface of the towers,
bringing forward all their elegance of form and enrichment with
decisive superiority.&nbsp; The secondary objects of the ruin,
overhung with ivy, and denied the direct light of the sun,
retired in a low tint; but at the left extremity of the picture,
the craggy and advancing citadel caught some of the strongest
lights and shades, forming an admirable bit of foreground to the
piece.&nbsp; Although I am of opinion, that by a morning light
this subject is <a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>seen by far to the greatest advantage, yet treated with
an afternoon effect, by the judicious pencil of Sir Richard
Hoare, it has formed a charming picture.&nbsp; This View the
engraver has ably transmitted to the publick in Mr. Coxe&rsquo;s
Survey of Monmouthshire.</p>
<p>Delighted with this first view, we traversed the porch
defended by two portcullisses, and entered the principal court of
the castle.&nbsp; The interior wore the same style of
magnificence that we so much admired without.&nbsp; In superior
grandeur projected the great window of the hall, majestically
canopied with ivy; a variegated verdure covered the once-paved
area, and climbed the lofty sides of the ruin.&nbsp; In some
places the fondling ivy ran through the forsaken chambers, and
embowered the apertures of the windows; while in many shadowy
recesses, where the early sun had not penetrated, the dewy
spangles of morning still decorated the dwarfy ash, or
tremulously bedecked the waving thistle.&nbsp; So admirably were
the different parts disposed, so picturesquely relieved, that the
whole seemed rather a fairy creation, than the fortuitous
combination of undirected nature.</p>
<p><a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>After
enjoying these general effects, we proceeded to examine the
apartments of the castle.&nbsp; These do not in any part seem of
very remote erection, but appear to have been constructed at
different periods between the ages of Henry the Fifth and
Elizabeth; yet, though a disunion of style be visible to the
Antiquary, no discordance of effect arises in any instance.&nbsp;
Of the first court, the principal entrance, and a range of once
elegant rooms, occupy the south side; the baronial hall, and some
other noble apartments, fill up the western part of the court;
the culinary and other domestic offices, with the servants
habitations, appear to have occupied the north and east sides: at
the angle of their junction, a pentagonal tower contained the
kitchen, and a small projection on the past side was the
oven.&nbsp; A broken flight of steps afforded us the means of
ascent to the superior apartments, where we admired the works of
our fore-fathers in some lightly-ornamented chimney-pieces and
Gothic mouldings.&nbsp; The baronial hall has suffered less from
time than from the pilfering attempts of the neighbourhood: some
traces of its former grandeur may be seen in its stately <a
name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>dimensions;
a prodigious fire-place; and a few remnants of ornament,
including the stone-sculptured arms of the Marquis of Worcester,
at one end of the hall: this place, once the scene of banqueting
and splendour, is now used as a fives-court.&nbsp; Here a fresh
instance might be collected of the fleeting state of sublunary
greatness; but so many have been brought forward by the great
geniusses of all ages, while every little one feels the truth
without benefiting by the knowledge, that we will not stop to
enlarge on so hopeless a subject; but proceed, where barons bold
have often trod, through the western portal of the hall to the
chapel.&nbsp; Few vestiges remain of this structure; but some of
its springing arches, rising from grotesque heads, are
imperfectly visible; and two whole-length figures, coarsely
executed, appear through the thick-woven ivy.&nbsp; From this
place we entered the area of the second court, once adorned with
a marble fountain and an equestrian statue; but now planted with
fruit-trees: this court is surrounded by a range of secondary yet
capital apartments.</p>
<p>The subterraneous appendages of the castle are uncommonly
extensive, according with <a name="page219"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 219</span>the great plan of the building;
eastward of which is the grange and out-houses, now converted
into a farming habitation.&mdash;Raglan Castle was one of the
latest that held out for the royal cause against Cromwell; and
the intrenchments raised for its defence, and against it, may be
readily traced in the adjoining fields. <a
name="citation219"></a><a href="#footnote219"
class="citation">[219]</a></p>
<p><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>Returning from this interesting ruin, we passed Raglan
church, a small Gothic building, containing a few mutilated
monuments of the Beaufort and Worcester families; and proceeded
on the turnpike-road to Chepstow.</p>
<p>Our route soon took a long and laborious ascent, <a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>from the
summit of which we obtained an extensive view over the middle
parts of Monmouthshire, an undulating tract of uncommon fertility
and high cultivation.&nbsp; The line of distant mountains that we
admired in the approach to Usk, here appeared strongly
diversified and singularly picturesque, with the continuous ridge
of the Black mountains to the west.&nbsp; Another considerable
height about three miles further commanded a similar view; from
which a short ride led us to the summit of the <span
class="smcap">Devaudon</span>; a remarkable elevation, whence a
prodigious view is ordinarily obtained, not only over the country
northward, but in the opposite direction, over the Bristol
channel and its opposing shores.&nbsp; A severe shower, however,
obliged us to relinquish this view, and seek shelter beneath the
boughs of Chepstow park, as we branched off on the turnpike
towards Caerwent.</p>
<p>Upon the storm abating, we wound down the Devaudon, and
descended into an agreeable valley, whose opposite hills were
clothed with wild forest-trees: the decayed town of Share Newton
occupied the summit of a high hill bordering the vale in the
direction of our route.&nbsp; We passed through <a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>this town
(a mere collection of cottages), and about half way towards the
village of Crick turned off the road to visit Wrunston, an
ecclesiastical ruin concealed in a sequestered thicket.&nbsp; The
picturesque remnant of a small chapel is the only part standing;
but extensive foundations and broad causeways declare the place
to have been once considerable.&mdash;From Crick, a genteel
village, we proceeded over an old Roman causeway <a
name="citation222"></a><a href="#footnote222"
class="citation">[222]</a> to Caerwent, the Venta Silurum of the
Romans.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Caerwent</span> occupies a
gently-inclining plane in a low situation.&nbsp; A few small
dwellings mark the site of the ancient town; the fortifications
of which form an oblong paralellogram, whose width is equal to
two-ninths of its length, with the corners a little rounded; a
frequent figure in Roman military works, called <i>Terriata
castra</i>.&nbsp; The corners <a name="page223"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 223</span>of the walls nearly correspond with
the four cardinal points.&nbsp; On the south-west side are three
pentagonal bastions; from which circumstance some authors have
conjectured the erection of the town to have taken place under
the lower empire, as flanking projections were not in use before
that period; but it is justly supposed to be equally probable,
that they were added after the general embattlement.&nbsp; The
circuit of the rampart, near a mile in extent, may still be
traced, in most places surrounded by a deep moat; the wall is
constructed of grout-work faced with squared lime-stone; but the
facings have been for the most part removed for private
uses.&nbsp; From the present ruinous state of the walls, we
cannot speak with certainty of their former height; but it
appears to have varied considerably; perhaps eighteen feet may be
a good medium: they are about twelve feet in thickness at their
base, and nine at top.&nbsp; A fragment of the wall, nearly
twenty feet in length and twelve high, has fallen near the
southern angle; and, although the ponderous ruin revolved in its
fall, the mass remains unshattered and impenetrable.&nbsp; Such
is the boundary of a spot once crowded with palaces <a
name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>and
temples: at present, the church and parsonage, a farm-house, a
public-house, and a few scattered cottages, chiefly built with
squared stones of the Roman town, are the only buildings on the
area, which is generally laid out in fields and orchards.&nbsp;
But ancient foundations, projecting above the level, and
concealed under green hillocks, rise in many places; and elegant
columns, tesselated pavements, and coins, are continually met
with in ploughing and digging.</p>
<p>We saw a tesselated or mosaic pavement, that was formerly much
admired, in an orchard behind the farm-house; which is thus
described by Mr. Wyndham in his tour, performed between thirty
and forty years since: &ldquo;The pavement is in length
twenty-one feet six inches, and in breadth eighteen feet.&nbsp; A
border, edged with the Greek scroll and fret, surrounds the
whole; but on the north side, the border, being upwards of three
feet, is much broader than the other side.&nbsp; This was
designed in order to reduce the circles within a square.&nbsp;
These circles are about three feet in diameter, and are encircled
with a variety of elegant ornaments, and separated from each
other by <a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
225</span>regular and equal distances.&nbsp; I think there are
thirteen of these circles.&nbsp; The pieces of which the pavement
is composed are nearly square, the breadth of them being about
the size of a common die.&nbsp; These are of various colours,
blue, white, yellow, and red; the first and second are of stone,
and the yellow and red are of terra cotta.&nbsp; By a judicious
mixture of these colours, the whole pattern is as strongly
described as it would have been in oil colours.&nbsp; The
original level is perfectly preserved; and the whole composition
is so elegant and well executed, that I think it has not been
surpassed by any mosaic pavement that has been discovered on
this, or even on the other side of the Alps.&nbsp; In my opinion,
it is equal to those beautiful pavements which are preserved in
the palace of the king of Naples at Portice.&nbsp; I am strongly
inclined to think that it is of the same age of
Agricola.&rdquo;&nbsp; On this pavement being discovered, a
building was erected to shelter it from the weather, by order of
the proprietor, Mr. Lewis, of St. Pierre; but the brewhouse
wanted a roof, and this, being found of similar dimensions, was
transferred <a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>to the brewhouse; the farmer holding his ale in much
greater veneration than relics of antiquity.&nbsp; In consequence
of neglect, this curiosity is no longer an object of beauty;
exposed to the weather, the surface became broken up; every one
being allowed to take away as many of the <i>tesser&aelig;</i> as
he pleased; but a small portion remains; and that is so overgrown
with grass as to be with difficulty distinguished.&nbsp; In this
orchard, and near the southern extremity of the wall, is a mound,
which is most probably the site of the exploratory, or
watch-tower.</p>

<p>Having satisfied ourselves with the antiquities of Caerwent,
we planned an excursion, to comprise the six castles mentioned by
the author of &ldquo;Secret Memoirs of Monmouthshire&rdquo; as
surrounding the forest of <span
class="smcap">Wentwood</span>.&nbsp; These were erected soon
after the Normans established themselves in Monmouthshire, in
order to keep the natives in check, who were wont to sally from
their <a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
228</span>impenetrable fastnesses in the woods, and take a severe
revenge on their conquerors and oppressors.&nbsp; Great part of
this forest still exists in its original wildness, although it
has been considerably curtailed by late enclosures.&nbsp; The
castles enumerated are, Dinham, Penhow, Pencoed, Lanvasches,
Lanvair, and Castrogy or Striguil.&nbsp; On a bridle-road,
extending to Share Newton, we proceeded to the village of <span
class="smcap">Dinham</span>, a poor place consisting of a few
farm-houses and cottages: we had some difficulty in discovering
the ruins of its castle, which consist of some low walls obscured
by trees; merely pointing out its site on a gentle eminence near
the borders of the forest.&nbsp; The ruin is called in the
neighbourhood the old chapel.&nbsp; There being nothing here to
fix our attention, we made the best of our way to <span
class="smcap">Lanvair Castle</span>, situated on a small rise
about two miles from Caerwent, near the road to Usk.&nbsp; In our
approach to the ruin, an effect caught through intervening trees
was pleasing and picturesque; but the ruin aspires not to
grandeur, and is in a great degree concealed by embowering
verdure: a nearer inspection of the castle increased our opinion
of its former <a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>extent and prowess; large foundations are evident; and
the walls are nowhere less than seven feet in thickness: a square
and two round towers are the most conspicuous features of the
ruin, which is in part moulded into a farm-house: the area of the
principal court is employed as a kitchen-garden.&nbsp; Beneath
the castellated eminence is the village-church, a simple rustic
building; passing which, and proceeding on the road to Usk, we
quickly entered the forest of Wentwood.&nbsp; In this tract a
dreary ride among dark woods, and russet heaths, laboriously
ascending, brought us to the <span class="smcap">Pencamawr</span>
summit; a remarkable eminence in the long ridge of hills crossing
the midland parts of Monmouthshire, from the vicinity of Caerleon
to the banks of the Wye near Landago.</p>
<p>Here a prospect greatly extensive opened to us.&nbsp; Beyond
the wild region prevailing about our eminence, broken into a
rapid succession of high hills and deep valleys, the winding Usk,
with its emeraldic valley, accompanied with numerous villas and
rich hanging woods, appeared in all its beauty.&nbsp; The bold
character of the foreground, soon melting into a gentle
undulation, displayed a <a name="page230"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 230</span>scene of cultivation and
productiveness of great extent; while, afar off, the line of
distant mountains about Abergavenny, which we had before admired,
again presented itself; somewhat varied, but not diminished in
excellence.&nbsp; Nor was the view southward less extensive,
comprehending a great part of the Bristol channel, with its
receding coast.</p>
<p>Slowly proceeding down a steep declivity, and admiring the
prospect before us, we soon reached <span
class="smcap">Striguil</span>, or <span class="smcap">Troggy
Castle</span>, as it is generally called, standing in a marshy
field at the bottom of the hill.&nbsp; The small remains of this
fortress are so profusely overspread with ivy, and the pendent
foliage of wide-branching trees, that an accurate judgement can
scarcely be formed of its architecture: but where the structure
can be seen, pointed arches with neat facings appear throughout;
from which circumstance the accuracy of Iceland and Camden may be
questioned, who date the erection of this castle prior to the
Conquest: certainly the parts now standing were not constructed
within a century subsequent to that event.&nbsp; An octagon tower
and some broken walls are the only standing parts of the ruin;
but the <a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
231</span>form of its area may be traced, which is oblong, with
towers defending each angle, and a broad moat surrounding the
whole.</p>
<p>Reascending the Pencamawr, a ride of four or five miles, upon
the site of a British way that led from Cardiff to Monmouth,
brought us into the turnpike-road between Newport and
Caerwent.&nbsp; In this interesting progress, on the ridgy summit
of the high hills bordering the Usk, our prospects were
delightful.&nbsp; Occasionally excluded by the close thickets of
the forest, and re-appearing under different circumstances, new
scenes were continually creating; and that satiety in consequence
avoided which would possibly have resulted from the long
possession of one species of scene, however excellent.&nbsp; Not
far distant from the Pencamawr, appear the antiquated mansion,
the hanging groves, and dark mantling woods of Bertholly,
impendent near the limpid Usk, which here makes one of its
boldest curves, forming nearly a complete circle in its romantic
meander.&nbsp; About two miles further, in a field on the right
of the road, is a building called Kemys Folly; from the summit of
which, a range of prospect is obtained, scarcely to be equalled
<a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>for
extent and diversity.&nbsp; The views described from the
Pencamawr here appear, with all the added charms of the scenery
of the Usk, in this part eminently beautiful: from this spot also
the Bristol channel displays its silvery surface with uncommon
effect; while the distant shores of Somerset and Devon follow its
course in bay and promontory, until the receding confine, too
remote for the distinction of sight, appears dissolved in the
blue ethereal.</p>
<p>From these charming scenes we descended, and in a short time
left the British way, in joining the Newport turnpike near a
public-house called Cat&rsquo;s Ash.&nbsp; This road is for the
most part constructed on the Julia strata of the Romans.&nbsp;
Where it leaves the absolute site of the ancient road it closely
follows its course, and the foundation of the causeway may be
traced in the adjoining fields; particularly in a meadow near the
spot, where a lane from Lanvair to Caldecot level crosses the
turnpike.&nbsp; Proceeding on this road somewhat more than a
mile, we turned off into a bridle-road on our right, to inspect
the remains of <span class="smcap">Pencoed castle</span> and
manor-house.&nbsp; These ruins are situated on the extreme
boundary of that hilly tract bordering Caldecot level, over <a
name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>which and
the Bristol channel it commands a comprehensive view.&nbsp; Of
the castle very inconsiderable vestiges appear, in a gateway with
a circular arch and two small pentagonal turrets, a round
embattled tower, and some dilapidated walls; yet, decorated with
a profusion of verdure, the ruin, though small, is picturesque
and pleasing.&nbsp; The architecture of these fragments is of a
more distant date than most of the small castles in
Monmouthshire, and may be considered co&euml;val with the first
establishment of the Normans in Gwent, <i>i.e.</i>
Monmouthshire.&nbsp; The mansion, occupying the site of the
baronial fortress, built with its materials and engrafted on its
foundation, is of an architectural date between Henry the
Eighth&rsquo;s reign and that of Elizabeth.&nbsp; This neglected
edifice is now partly occupied as a farm-house; but indications
of its former importance appear in the grand dimensions of the
apartments, and the great general extent of the building.</p>
<p>Upon regaining the high road, we soon approached <span
class="smcap">Penhow Castle</span>, seated on an eminence, and
commanding the pass of a wild hollow beneath: a square embattled
tower is the leading feature of this ruin, <a
name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>which is
very inconsiderable, and chiefly converted into a small farming
habitation:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There in the ruin, heedless of the dead,<br
/>
The shelter-seeking peasant builds his shed;<br />
And, wond&rsquo;ring man could want the larger pile,<br />
Exults, and owns his cottage with a smile.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus having surveyed five out of the six castles that formerly
surrounded the forest of Wentwood, and learning that no traces
remained of the fortress at Lanvasches, we returned to Caerwent
from a circuit of about twenty miles.</p>
<p>At an early hour in the morning we set out from our lowly
quarters at Caerwent, and traversed a fruitful country,
pleasingly varied with wood and pastures, in our way to <span
class="smcap">Caldecot Castle</span>.&nbsp; The situation of this
ruin in an undiversified swampy plain, is not calculated to set
off its importance: viewed from a superior elevation in the
approach, the towers and citadel, in themselves sufficiently
high, appear sunk, and undistinguished from the curtain wall of
the fortification; but on a nearer inspection the ruin rises in
consequence; and the aspect of its chief entrance, a large Gothic
gateway guarded by two massive projecting towers, is truly
noble.&nbsp; The light grey <a name="page235"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 235</span>masonry of this entrance is
agreeably relieved by a profusion of ivy, overspreading nearly
the whole of one tower, and throwing the broad shadow of its
pendent foliage upon part of the other.&nbsp; Within the portal
the grooves of two portcullisses are apparent; and a further
means of defence is visible in holes through the arch, down which
boiling lead might be poured on the heads of the besiegers.&nbsp;
On entering the court some remains of the baronial hall, and the
foundations of other buildings, appear within the area of the
walls.&nbsp; A small artificial mount at the north-east angle of
the ruin sustains the citadel, a lofty round tower; to which
<i>dernier resort</i> of the garrison a ready communication seems
to have been conducted on the walls, from the different towers
and other parts of the fortress; the whole of which is surrounded
by a broad and deep moat.</p>
<p>The early history of this castle is uncertain: some have
conjectured that part of it was built by Harold; and indeed a
round tower on the south-west side of the castle, with a
circularly arched entrance, has a Saxon character; but the
general architecture of the building is Gothic.&nbsp; Caldecot
castle, <a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
236</span>in the different accounts of Monmouthshire, has been
attached to the lord high constableship of England, upon the
authority of Camden; <a name="citation236"></a><a
href="#footnote236" class="citation">[236]</a> but it appears
very satisfactorily, from Mr. Coxe&rsquo;s illustration, that it
was the <i>private</i> property of the great Bohun family
possessing the earldom of Hereford, who were hereditary
constables of England.&nbsp; Caldecot church is an extensive and
highly-ornamented Gothic structure, which may appear somewhat
disproportioned to the scanty flock that it has to fold.</p>
<p>Leaving the little village of Caldecot, we passed the Nevern
brook, and soon after the small hamlet of Portswit, formerly
washed by the sea, though it has since receded upwards of a
mile.&nbsp; This place brought to our recollection a tale of
outrage and cruelty that strongly characterizes the state of
society at the time, and may serve as a buoy to mark the lawless
violence of military dominion.&nbsp; It is related in
Powell&rsquo;s translation of Caradoc&rsquo;s history, that
Harold, after wresting part of Prince Gryffith&rsquo;s
possessions from him, built a magnificent palace at Portascyth
(Portswit) <a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>in Monmouthshire; &ldquo;and, stowing it with a great
quantity of provision, splendidly entertained the king, who
honoured him with a visit.&nbsp; This was by no means pleasing to
Tosty, to see his younger brother in greater esteem and favour
with the king than himself; and, having concealed his displeasure
for a time, he could not forbear at length but discover his
grievance; for one day at Windsor, while Harold reached the cup
to King Edward, Tosty, ready to burst with envy that his brother
was so much respected beyond himself, could not refrain to run
furiously upon him, and, pulling him by the hair, dragged him to
the ground; for which unmannerly action the king forbade him the
court.&nbsp; But he, with continued rancour and malice, rides to
Hereford, where Harold had many servants preparing an
entertainment for the king; and, setting upon them with his
followers, lopped off the hands and legs of some, the arms and
heads of others, and then threw them into the butts of wine and
other liquors which were put in for the king&rsquo;s drinking;
and at his departure charged the servants to acquaint <a
name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>him,
&lsquo;that of other fresh meat he might carry with him what he
pleased; but for sauce he should find plenty provided for
him.&rsquo;&nbsp; For which barbarous offence the king pronounced
perpetual banishment upon him.&nbsp; But Caradoc ap Gryffydth
gave a finishing stroke to Harold&rsquo;s house, and the
king&rsquo;s entertainment at Portascyth; for, coming thither
shortly after Tosty&rsquo;s departure, to be revenged upon
Harold, he killed all the workmen and labourers, with all the
servants he could find; and, utterly defacing the building,
carried away all the costly materials, which, with great charges
and expence, had been brought thither to beautify and adorn the
structure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Proceeding through an agreeable undulating tract towards the
sea-shore, we soon arrived at the <span class="smcap">New
Passage</span>, the principal entrance into Monmouthshire from
the south-western counties. <a name="citation238"></a><a
href="#footnote238" class="citation">[238]</a>&nbsp; The breadth
of water from this place to the Bristol coast is three miles <a
name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>and a half,
while the ferry of Aust, or the Old passage, four or five miles
higher up the Severn, is only two miles across; but this
advantage is considered to be overbalanced by the more commodious
landing at the former.&nbsp; Both these concerns, being
monopolies, are, like all other monopolies, hostile to the
interest of the publick; for there being no competition for
preference between the boatmen, they are extremely rude in their
manners, indifferent to the accommodation of the publick, and by
no means unpractised in various arts of extortion.&nbsp; But
these exclusive privileges have existed from time
immemorial.&nbsp; The title of the New Passage arose from its
renewal in the year 1718, after an abolition in consequence of
the following remarkable incident.</p>
<p>Charles the First, being pursued by a strong party of his
enemies through Share Newton, got into a boat at the Black rock
(the New passage), and was ferried to the opposite shore.&nbsp;
His pursuers, to the number of sixty, with drawn swards compelled
other boatmen belonging to the passage to ferry them after him;
but these, being in the king&rsquo;s interest, landed them on a
reef of rocks in the Severn called the <a
name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>English
stones, near the Gloucestershire coast, to which they were
instructed to ford: indeed, the strait was fordable at low water;
but, the tide flowing in very rapidly, they were all drowned in
the attempt, and the king for that time escaped.&nbsp; Cromwell,
informed of the transaction, abolished the ferry; nor was it
renewed, until after a long chancery-suit between an ancestor of
the present proprietor, Mr. Lewis, of St. Pierre, and the
guardians of his Grace the Duke of Beaufort, proprietor of Aust
ferry.</p>
<p>A walk of a mile, on the shore westward of New Passage inn,
led us to <span class="smcap">Sudbrook encampment</span>,
crowning the brow of an eminence which rises in an abrupt cliff
from Caldecot level.&nbsp; This work, consisting of three
ramparts and two ditches, forms a semicircle, whose chord is the
sea cliff; but it is evident, that part of the eminence has
mouldered away; and most probable, that the figure of the
fortification was once circular.&nbsp; Harris conjectures it to
be of Roman origin, and intended for the defence of the port of
Venta Silurum (Caerwent).&nbsp; Eastward of the encampment is
<span class="smcap">Sudbrook Chapel</span>, a small Gothic ruin,
which was formerly attached <a name="page241"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 241</span>to a mansion of Norman
foundation.&nbsp; No traces appear even of the site of this
structure, which has in all likelihood been swept away by the
encroachment of the sea: but several piles of hewn stones near
the ramparts are probably its relics.</p>
<p>We had another pleasant walk of about a mile from the New
passage across the fields to <span class="smcap">St.
Pierre</span>, an ancient residence of the Lewis family,
descended from Cadivor the great.&nbsp; This mansion exhibits
rather an incongruous mixture, in which the modern refinements of
sash-windows, &amp;c. are forced upon a Gothic structure upwards
of four hundred years old: an embattled gateway, flanked with
pentagonal towers, is still more ancient, and is recorded as
having belonged to the feudal castle that occupied the site of
the present building.</p>
<p>Nearly opposite this spot, the great estuary of the Bristol
channel, contracting in width, takes the name of the
Severn.&nbsp; The appellation of this river arises from the story
of a British princess.&nbsp; Geoffry of Monmouth relates, that
she was the daughter of Locrine king of Britain, by Elstridis,
one of the three virgins of matchless charms whom he took <a
name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>after he
had defeated Humber king of the Huns, to whom they
belonged.&nbsp; Locrine had divorced his former queen Guendolin
in her favour.&nbsp; On his death, Guendolin assumed the
government, pursued Elstridis and her daughter Sabra with
unrelenting cruelty, and caused them to be drowned in the river,
which with some alteration took the name of this innocent
victim.&nbsp; Our poets have made a beautiful use of this story:
Milton, in his description of rivers, speaks of</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Severn swift, guilty of maiden
blood;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but in the Mask of Comus he enters fully into her sad
story:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There is a gentle nymph not far from
hence,<br />
That with moist curb sways the smooth Severn stream:<br />
Sabrina is her name, a virgin pure;<br />
Whilome she was the daughter of Locrine,<br />
That had the scepter from his father Brute.<br />
She, guiltless damsel, flying the mad pursuit<br />
Of her enraged stepdame Guendolin,<br />
Commended her fair innocence to the flood,<br />
That stay&rsquo;d her flight with his cross-flowing course.<br />
The water-nymphs that in the bottom play&rsquo;d<br />
Held up their pearled wrists and took her in,<br />
Bearing her strait to aged Nereus&rsquo; hall;<br />
Who, piteous of his woes, rear&rsquo;d her lank head,<br />
And gave her to his daughters to imbathe<br />
In nectar&rsquo;d lavers strow&rsquo;d with asphodil,<br />
And through the porch and inlet of each sense<br />
<a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>Dropt in
ambrosial oils till she reviv&rsquo;d,<br />
And underwent a quick immortal change,<br />
Made Goddess of the river.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crossing the grounds of St. Pierre, and passing Pool Meyrick,
a brook falling into the Severn, we turned to the right in search
of <span class="smcap">Mathern Palace</span>, formerly a seat of
the bishops of Landaff.&nbsp; This building, situated in a gentle
hilly country pleasingly diversified with wood and pasturage, in
its present appearance conveys but a very faint idea of the
splendour and good cheer that no doubt reigned there when it was
the seat of the episcopacy.&nbsp; The structure surrounds a
quadrangular court, and was raised by different bishops; the
north and north-east parts, comprising the tower, porch, &amp;c.
are supposed to have been erected by John de la Zouch, who was
consecrated anno 1408.&nbsp; Miles Salley, who came to the see in
1504, built the chapel, hall, and other apartments.&nbsp; Some
specimens of dilapidated grandeur appear in the east window; and
until lately the entrance was through a lofty ornamented porch;
but this is now destroyed, and the building only occupied as a
farm-house.&nbsp; In the north side of the chancel of Mathern
church, a <a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
244</span>Gothic structure, but of British origin, is the
following epitaph written by bishop Godwin; the substance of
which accounts for the manor of Mathern&rsquo;s becoming
ecclesiastical:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Here lyeth entombed the
body of<br />
Theodorick, king of Morganuck, or<br />
Glamorgan, commonly called<br />
St. Thewdrick, and accounted a martyr<br />
because he was slain in a battle against<br />
the Saxons, being then Pagans, and in<br />
defence of the Christian religion.&nbsp; The<br />
battle was fought at Tintern, where he<br />
obtained a great victory.&nbsp; He died here,<br />
being in his way homeward, three<br />
days after the battle, having taken<br />
order with Maurice his son, who succeeded<br />
him in the Kingdom, that in the<br />
same place he should happen to decease a<br />
church should be built, and his body buried<br />
in the same; which was accordingly performed<br />
in the year 600. <a name="citation244"></a><a href="#footnote244"
class="citation">[244]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Within a short distance of Mathern is <span
class="smcap">Moinscourt</span>, another deserted ecclesiastical
mansion, attributed to the erection of Bishop Godwin, and also
occupied as a farm-house.&nbsp; This exhibits a handsome Gothic
porch <a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
245</span>defended by two lofty turrets: within the court-yard
are the two Roman inscribed stones mentioned by Gibson in the
supplement to Camden, and said to have been brought from
Caerleon: one of these appears to have been a votive altar; the
other records the repairing or rebuilding of the temple of Diana
by T. H. Posthumius Varus.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">CHEPSTOW&mdash;FINE SCENERY OF ITS
VICINAGE&mdash;THE CASTLE&mdash;CHURCH, AND
BRIDGE&mdash;PIERCEFIELD&mdash;CHARACTER OF THE LATE MR.
MORRIS.</p>
<p>Upon meeting our horses at the village of St. Pierre, we
proceeded towards Chepstow, and in a few minutes were surprized
with a range of naked cliffs, rising in appearance from the tract
of verdure before us; a venerable wood shadowed the brow of the
rocks, in front of which rose a forest of masts with waving
pennants.&nbsp; This singular combination resulted from the
position of <span class="smcap">Chepstow</span> and its port, in
an abrupt hollow, inclosed by considerable heights in every
direction.&nbsp; The whole unfolded itself like a map beneath us,
as we descended to the town; an irregular-built trading place,
but where the <a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
247</span>well-furnished houses and opulent establishments of
many of the inhabitants engaged in business prove the success of
their commercial enterprize: yet the town, having no
manufactories, depends altogether on the carrying trade.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p247b.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>We hastened from an excellent repast at the Beaufort Arms, to
enjoy the scenery in the vicinity of Chepstow-bridge; where an
assemblage of objects was disclosed, highly interesting,
imposing, and beautiful.&nbsp; Below the bridge, and on the
opposite side of the deep and rapid Wye, enlivened by numerous
shipping, a series of cliffs appeared issuing from the water,
whose rocky surface, warmly tinted with various hues of red and
yellow, was pleasingly diversified with the vivid green of
aspiring ivy, while the lofty summits were fringed with impendent
oaks.&nbsp; This trait was highly agreeable; but directing our
attention up the river, the princely ruin of Chepstow Castle,
stretching along a grand perpendicular cliff, which proudly
emerges from the stream; and the steep hills of Piercefield
rearing their varied plantations, in leafy majesty, from the
river to the clouds; were features too nobly impressive not to <a
name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 248</span>stamp an
interest in the coldest observer.&nbsp; A transient gaze did not
satisfy us: we paused a long time over the rails of the bridge;
advanced to the opposite shores; compared the varying effect at
different distances and elevations; and, as we changed our points
of view, discovered fresh gleams of picturesque beauty at every
movement.&nbsp; Nor were the leading objects of this scene less
gratifying when examined in detail, than the striking
<i>coup-d&rsquo;&oelig;il</i> of their general composition.</p>
<p>As we advanced toward the massive battlements and lofty
turrets of Chepstow&rsquo;s ancient castle, the grand entrance, a
Norman arch flanked by circular towers, figured all the repulsive
gloom of feudal reserve and violence; even the very knocker was
emblematical of hostility; for we thundered at the portal for
admission with a cannon-ball suspended by a chain.&nbsp; The
warder of the castle did not wind his horn in reply, nor, raising
himself on the ramparts, did he demand our quality and business;
but a pretty smiling damsel, conjuring up all her rosy dimples,
bade the gate, or rather made it, revolve on its creaking hinges,
and welcomed us into the castle.</p>
<p><a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>Upon
entering the court, our attention was somewhat divided, between
the remains of the baronial hall, numerous apartments, and the
kitchen, which surrounded the area; and the well-turned arm that
pointed to the several objects.&nbsp; A number of rooms in this
court are kept in repair, and form a commodious residence, which
is tenanted by Mr. Williams under a lease from the Duke of
Beaufort.&nbsp; From this we passed to the second court, now laid
out as a kitchen-garden.&nbsp; The third court contained the
chapel, a fine remnant of antiquity, possessing a greater degree
of decoration than any other part of the castle; a range of
niches appear within the walk of this structure, at some distance
from the floor, which is said to have been filled with statues;
and the mortices of beams seem to indicate, that a gallery was
conducted round the room.&nbsp; The style of the windows and
enrichments is Gothic; but the original part of the building is
Norman.&nbsp; Indeed, a unity of design and architecture appears
throughout the fundamental parts of the castle; although, as may
be expected, the continual alterations and additions of
successive proprietors have left us several specimens of the <a
name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
250</span>intermediate modes of building between the Norman
foundation and the present age.&nbsp; Among the undecorative
additions of the latter period, are the deserted works of a
glass-house, and a dog-kennel.&nbsp; Beyond the chapel we
ascended a flight of steps to the battlements, shadowed by wide
branching trees of various descriptions, issuing from the moat
beneath.&nbsp; Opposite to us, beyond the moat, appeared the low
embowered ruins of the fourth and last court, separated from the
principal mass of building by a drawbridge.</p>
<p>Returning, our fair guide conducted us to a subterraneous
chamber with an engroined roof, excavated in the rock, beneath
the ruin, and opening to the overhanging brow of the cliff.&nbsp;
Here several old ivys darted from stony fissures that seemed to
forbid vegetation, binding the mouldering summit of the cliff in
their sinewy embrace; and, shedding their light tendrils round
the cavern, embowered its aperture as they aspired in frequent
volutions to the loftiest turrets of the pile.&nbsp; Here, and
from several points in our perambulation of the ruin, we timidly
looked down on the rapid Wye, rolling its swelling tide at an
immense depth perpendicularly <a name="page251"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 251</span>beneath us; and at other times the
green waving hills of Piercefield rose in all their peculiar
grandeur to our view, darkening the river with their widely
projected shadows.</p>
<p>Before we left this baronial fortress, we did not fail to
explore a large round tower in the first court, that was the
ancient citadel; but is more noticed for having been the prison
of Harry Martin the regicide.&nbsp; We entered a Gothic doorway,
and, following the taper heels of our gentle conductress up a
spiral staircase, visited each apartment in the tower; all of
which proved spacious and commodious. <a
name="citation251a"></a><a href="#footnote251a"
class="citation">[251a]</a>&nbsp; Here the parliamentary colonel
was confined near thirty years; but not in the &ldquo;durance
vile&rdquo; which his sympathizing biographer represents: <a
name="citation251b"></a><a href="#footnote251b"
class="citation">[251b]</a> his family lived with him, and he had
offices for his servants; he had the free range of the castle in
the day-time; and, with a guard, was allowed <a
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>to visit
the neighbouring gentry.&nbsp; Even in the tottering state of
royalty, on Charles the Second&rsquo;s restoration, this sort of
confinement was found sufficient to answer the ends of justice,
and security to the ruling powers; although the republican
leader, the turbulent and enterprising Harry Martin, was the
prisoner; ever glorying in his principles, and declaring, that
were the treason of which he had been legally convicted to be
repeated, he should enter on his part without reluctance.</p>
<p>The building of Chepstow (or Estrighoel) Castle, although
carried by some antiquaries to the &aelig;ra of Julius
C&aelig;sar, <a name="citation252"></a><a href="#footnote252"
class="citation">[252]</a> appears to have taken place in the
eleventh century, when William Fitzosborn, Earl of Hereford,
built the castle to defend the ample possessions granted him in
this quarter by William the <a name="page253"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 253</span>Conqueror, his relation.&nbsp; His
son and successor, Roger de Britolio, taking up arms against his
sovereign, was deprived of his vast inheritance; and Chepstow
castle became soon after transferred to the noble family of
Clare.&nbsp; This fortress is remarkable in history for the
gallant defence that it made, with a slender garrison, against a
considerable force headed by Oliver Cromwell; but after a long
siege it was taken by an assault, in which nearly all its
defenders were sacrificed.</p>
<p>The church of Chepstow, situated at the extremity of the town,
below the bridge, exhibits a curious specimen of Norman
architecture, in the massive arches resting on piers within, and
the richly ornamented mouldings of the western entrance.&nbsp;
The tower was erected during the last century.&nbsp; This church
formed the nave of a much larger structure which belonged to a
priory of Benedictine monks, founded by the builder of the
castle.&nbsp; Some remains of the priory walls may be traced near
the church, and of several other religious buildings in different
parts of the town.</p>
<p><a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
254</span>Chepstow Bridge is a singular structure: it was
formerly entirely built with timber; but the piers of the
Monmouthshire half are now constructed of stone.&nbsp; The
flooring of this bridge, like that of many others in the county,
is formed of thick planks, which are kept firm in their places by
tenons, or rather wedges of wood.&nbsp; It is usually said, that
this flooring is loose, and calculated to rise with the torrents,
which sometimes swelling above the bridge would otherwise carry
it away; but the fact is, that the planks are not loose: as I was
informed by a workman repairing the floor, they are fastened in
the manner related, in preference to nailing, that they may be
more easily replaced when worn out.&nbsp; The tide here is
reckoned to rise higher than in any other part of the world;
accumulating to the height of seventy feet at particular periods;
but a late examination has proved fifty-six feet to be the
highest point that it has risen to during the present generation;
which, though a very great rise, is not superior to what happens
in some other places.&nbsp; The cause of this extraordinary swell
proceeds from the rocks of Beachly and Aust; which, protruding
far into the Severn <a name="page255"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 255</span>near the mouth of the Wye, obstruct
the flow of the tide, and oblige it to turn with increased
rapidity into the latter river.&nbsp; I am informed, that the
ruined chapel on a rock, near the mouth of the Wye, in the
Severn, is an excellent subject for the pencil, in composition
with the cliffs of Beachly and the adjacent scenery. <a
name="citation255"></a><a href="#footnote255"
class="citation">[255]</a></p>
<p>On quitting Chepstow, and proceeding about a mile and half on
the road to Monmouth, a capital lodge with iron gates and
palisadoes announced the entrance of <span
class="smcap">Piercefield</span>.&nbsp; Eager to view this
enchanting domain, the favourite resort and theme of tourists,
nor less the pride of Monmouthshire, we applied at the gate for
admission; when a well-grown lad made his appearance, who stared
at us through the rails, with more than the usual stupidity of
boys brought up at a distance from towns.&nbsp; Again and again,
with entreaties and threats, we stated our business; but nothing
could excite the gaping vacuity of his countenance, or induce him
to open the gate.&nbsp; Rightly concluding that he was <a
name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>an idiot,
we were returning towards the town for instructions how to act,
when a venerable pate with &ldquo;silver crowned&rdquo; appeared
at the window of the lodge, and by dint of hallooing and
patience, in waiting upwards of a quarter of an hour, we had the
old man at the gate.&nbsp; He was the boy&rsquo;s grand-father;
and, if intellect were hereditary, the boy might presume on his
lineage with more chance of correctness than many of higher
birth.&nbsp; The old man, after obliging us to hear a tedious
incomprehensible narrative to account for his babbling
attendance, at length concluded by telling us, that we could not
upon any account see the grounds, as they were only shewn on
Tuesdays and Fridays.&nbsp; This was on a Saturday; but to wait
until the following Tuesday would be a tax indeed; and to proceed
without seeing Piercefield a sad flaw in our tour; so we essayed
with success a means which, it may be remarked, when applied in a
due proportion to its object, is scarcely ever known to fail.</p>
<p>We rode up an embowered lane to the village of <span
class="smcap">St. Arvans</span>, and, leaving our horses at the
blacksmith&rsquo;s, entered <span class="smcap">Piercefield
Grounds</span> at a back gate.&nbsp; Here commencing <a
name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>a walk of
three miles in length, we passed through agreeable plantations of
oak, ash, and elm, to the edge of a perpendicular cliff, called
the Lover&rsquo;s Leap, overlooking an abyss-like hollow, whose
fearful depth is softened by a tract of forest extending over the
surrounding rocks.&nbsp; High above competition at the northern
extremity of the scene rises Wynd cliff: a dark wood fringes its
lofty summit, and shelves down its sides to the river Wye, which
urges its sinuous course at the bottom of the glen.&nbsp; In one
place, the river, gently curving, appears in all the breadth of
its channel; in another, projecting rocks and intervening foliage
conceal its course, or sparingly exhibit its darkened
surface.&nbsp; Following the bend of the river on its marginal
height, a range of naked perpendicular cliffs (the Banagor rocks)
appear above the wooded hills that prevail through the scenery;
of so regular a figure, that one can scarcely help imagining it
the fortification of a town, with curtains, bastions, and
demi-bastions.&nbsp; But a very leading feature is, the peninsula
of Llanicut: the hills of Piercefield, here receding into a
semicircular bend, watered by the river immediately beneath, <a
name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>are opposed
by a similar concavity in the Banagor rocks: the whole forming a
grand amphitheatre of lofty woods and precipices.&nbsp; From the
opposite side descends a fertile expanse, or tongue of land,
filling up the area of the circle.&nbsp; This singular valley is
laid out in a compact ornamented farm; the richly verdant meadows
are intersected by flourishing hedge-rows; while numerous trees
diversify the tract, and imbower the farm-house: a row of elms
shadows the margin of the river, which, skirting the base of the
hills, nearly surrounds the valley.</p>
<p>These subjects disclose themselves in different combinations
through intervals in the shrubbery which encloses the walk; and
which, although selected from the nicest observations, are
managed with so just an attention to the simplicity of nature, as
to appear the work of her plastic hand.</p>
<p>The Giant&rsquo;s Cave, a little further, is a passage cut
through a rock.&nbsp; Over one of the entrances is a mutilated
colossal figure, which once sustained the fragment of a rock in
his uplifted arms, threatening to overwhelm whoever dared enter
his retreat; but some time <a name="page259"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 259</span>since the stone fell, carrying the
Giant&rsquo;s arms along with it; yet he continues to grin
horribly, although deprived of his terrors.&nbsp; From this place
a path, traced under the woods, descends to the bath, a
commodious building concealed from outward view by impendent
foliage.</p>
<p>Deserting for a while the course of the river, we ascend a
superior eminence called the Double View, whence the different
scenes that have presented themselves in detail appear in one
comprehensive range.&nbsp; Here too a new field of prospect
discloses itself, much more extensive than the former, and
beautifully picturesque.&nbsp; The mazy Wye, with all its
interesting accompaniments, passes from beneath us, through a
richly variegated country, to its junction with the Severn,
beyond whose silvery expanse the grand swelling shores of
Somersetshire form the distance.&nbsp; A curious <i>deceptio
visus</i> occurring here must not be passed over: it arises from
a coincidence in the angle of vision between the embattled rocks
already mentioned, and a part of the Severn; which appears to
wash their summit, although in reality it is many miles
distant.&nbsp; But the subject of the prospect <a
name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>from this
spot is seen much more picturesquely combined as we continue our
walk on a gentle descent, and catch the varying scene through
apertures in the foliage; yet there is something that one would
wish to add or remove, until we reach the grotto, when a picture
is exhibited in the happiest taste of composition.</p>
<p>In this charming view from the grotto, a diversified
plantation occupies the fore-ground, and descends through a grand
hollow to the river, which passes in a long reach under the
elevated ruin of Chepstow Castle, the town and bridge, towards
the Severn.&nbsp; Rocks and precipices, dark shelving forests,
groves, and lawns, hang on its course; and, with a variety of
sailing-vessels, are reflected from the liquid mirror, with an
effect that I cannot attempt to describe, and at which the magic
pencil of a Claude would falter.&nbsp; The distant Severn and its
remote shores form an excellent termination, and complete the
picture.</p>

<p>On our visit, the rich extent of variegated woods that mantles
this charming domain received an additional diversity in the
endless gradations of autumnal tints that chequered their
surface; while in a few <a name="page261"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 261</span>places the still uniform
<i>sombre</i> hue of the pine and larch was admirably relieved by
the silvered verdure of the lightly-branching ground-ash and
witch-hazel.</p>
<p>Highly gratified with this delightful scenery, we returned by
another track through tangled shrubberies, open groves, and
waving lawns, to the mansion.&nbsp; This edifice is constructed
of free-stone, and has had two handsome wings lately added to it
by Colonel Wood, the present proprietor of the estate.&nbsp;
Although not very extensive, it has nevertheless an elegant
external appearance; and, as we were informed, is fitted up
internally with a taste and splendour little inferior to any of
our first-rate houses in England. <a name="citation261"></a><a
href="#footnote261" class="citation">[261]</a></p>
<p>Remounting our horses at the village of St. Arvans, a steep
ascent led over some outgrounds of Piercefield to the summit of
Wyndcliff, where a prodigious extent of prospect burst upon us;
comprehending at one view, not only the different scenes in the
neighbourhood of Chepstow, which appeared sunk into the lines of
a map, but a wonderful range over nine counties.</p>
<p><a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>The
charms of Piercefield were created by Valentine Morris, Esq.
about fifty years since; to say unfolded, may be more correct;
for the masterly hand of nature modelled every feature; the taste
of Mr. Morris discovered them in an unnoticed forest, and
disclosed them to the world: he engrafted the blandishments of
art upon the majestic wildness of the scene without distorting
its original character.</p>
<p>Philanthropic, hospitable, and magnificent, his house was
promiscuously open to the numerous visitors whom curiosity led to
his improvements; but alas! by his splendid liberality, his
unbounded benevolence, and unforeseen contingencies, his fortune
became involved; he was obliged to part with his estate, and take
refuge in the West Indies.&nbsp; Before he left his country, he
took a farewel view of Piercefield, and with manly resignation
parted with that idol of his fancy.&nbsp; The industrious poor
around, whose happiness he had promoted by his exertions and
bounty, crowded towards him, and on their knees implored the
interposition of Providence for the preservation of their
benefactor: tears and prayers were all they had to offer; nor <a
name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 263</span>could they
be suspected of insincerity; for in lamenting their
protector&rsquo;s misfortunes they but mourned their own.&nbsp;
In this trial he saw unmoved (at least in appearance) the
widows&rsquo; and orphans&rsquo; anguish, though he was wont to
melt at the bare mention of their sorrows.&nbsp; His firmness did
not forsake him in quitting this affecting group, as his chaise
drove off towards London; but having crossed Chepstow-bridge, the
bells, muffled, as is usual on occasions of great public
calamity, rang a mournful peal.&nbsp; Unprepared for this mark of
affection and respect, he could no longer control his feelings,
and burst into tears.</p>
<p>In leaving England he did not shake off his evil
destiny.&nbsp; Being appointed governor of St. Vincent&rsquo;s,
he expended the residue of his fortune in advancing the
cultivation of the colony, and raising works for its defence,
when the island fell into the hands of the French.&nbsp;
Government failing to reimburse his expences during his life,
upon his return to England he was thrown into the
King&rsquo;s-bench prison by his creditors.&nbsp; Here he
experienced all the rigour of penury and imprisonment for seven
years.&nbsp; Of the numerous sharers of his prosperity, only his
<a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 264</span>amiable
wife <a name="citation264"></a><a href="#footnote264"
class="citation">[264]</a> and a single friend devoted themselves
to participate his misery and alleviate his distress.&nbsp; Even
the clothes and trinkets of his lady were sold to purchase bread;
and, that nothing might be wanting to fill up his cup of
bitterness, the faithful partner of his cares, unable to bear up
against continued and accumulating misery, became insane.</p>
<p>At length he recovered his liberty; and fortune, tired of this
long persecution, seemed to abate somewhat of her rigour; when
death put an end to his chequered career at the house of his
brother-in-law, Mr. Wilmot, in Bloomsbury-square, in
1789.&mdash;The neighbourhood still sounds the praises of this
worthy gentleman.&nbsp; Old men, in recounting his good actions
and unmerited misfortunes, seem warmed with the enthusiasm of
youth; and little children sigh while they lisp the sufferings of
Good Mr. Morris.</p>

OF THE WYE TO MONMOUTH&mdash;OLD TINTERN&mdash;BROOK&rsquo;S
WEIR&mdash;LANDAGO&mdash;REDBROOK.</p>
<p>How teaming with objects of curiosity and beauty is
Monmouthshire!&nbsp; Within two or three miles of Piercefield we
reached the justly-famed ruin of <span class="smcap">Tintern
Abbey</span>: its dark mouldering walls, solemnly rising above
surrounding trees, appeared to us, in turning from a deep-wooded
hollow, with a most impressive effect. <a
name="citation265"></a><a href="#footnote265"
class="citation">[265]</a>&nbsp; At the village adjoining <a
name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>we put up
at the Beaufort Arms, the landlord of which, Mr. Gething, holds
the key of the ruin, and who, extraordinary as it may seem,
unites unaffected civility and kindness with upwards of forty
years initiation into the business of an inn-keeper, and, as the
neighbours say, a well-lined purse.&nbsp; Passing the works of an
iron-foundry, and a train of miserable cottages engrafted on the
offices of the abbey, we found ourselves under the west front of
the ruin.&nbsp; This confined approach, incumbered by mean
buildings, is not calculated to inspire one with a very high
estimation of its consequence: but, on the door&rsquo;s being
thrown open, an effect bursts on the spectator, of so majestic
and singular a description, that words can neither do justice to
its merit, nor convey an adequate idea of the scene.&nbsp; It is
neither a mere creation of art nor an exhibition of
nature&rsquo;s charms; but a grand spectacle, in which <a
name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>both seem
to have blended their powers in producing something beautiful and
sublime!</p>
<p>Through long ranges of Gothic pillars and arches, some
displaying all the exquisite workmanship of their clustered
shafts, while others are hung with shadowy festoons of ivy, or
lightly decorated with its waving tendrils, the eye passes; and,
for a moment arrested by the lofty arches rising in the middle of
the structure that formerly supported the tower, it glides to the
grand window at the termination of the ruin.&nbsp; Beyond this
aperture, distinguished by a shaft of uncommon lightness
springing up the middle, some wild wooded hills on the opposite
side of the Wye rear their dusky summits, and close the scene
with much congenial grandeur.&nbsp; The ruin is generally in a
high state of preservation; the outer walls are perfect; and the
elegant tracery of the west window above the entrance has not
suffered in one of its members.&nbsp; A singular circumstance of
this ruin, and to which may be ascribed its superior effect, is,
that the fallen roof and all the other rubbish have been removed
to the original level of the pavement by order of the Duke of
Beaufort, and a greensward smooth as a bowling-green <a
name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>extended
throughout.&nbsp; Hence all the parts rise in their original and
due proportion, and with an undisturbed effect.&nbsp; At the same
time, the uniformity of a lawn-like surface is diversified with
several clunks; consisting of broken columns, cornices, and the
mutilated effigies of monks and heroes, <a
name="citation268"></a><a href="#footnote268"
class="citation">[268]</a> whose ashes repose within the walls:
Light branching trees start from their interstices, and throw a
doubtful shadow over the sculptured fragments.</p>
<p>Tintern Abbey is cruciform; The length of the nave and choir
is two hundred and thirty feet; their width, thirty-three; and it
is a hundred and sixty feet to the extremes of the
transept.&nbsp; It was founded for Cistercian monks by Walter de
Clare, anno 1131; and in 1238, according to William of Worcester,
the abbot and monks entered the choir, and celebrated the first
mass at the high altar.&nbsp; It is probable, that only that part
of the building was then competed, as the other parts <a
name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>the church
are of a later style of architecture; and it was no uncommon
thing for the choir to be built and consecrated before the rest
of the structure was finished.</p>
<p>On entering the abbey, it was determined that we should
proceed no further that day: getting rid, therefore, of my
companion and landlord, who retired in a consultation about
dinner, I locked myself in, and employed several hours without
interruption in sketching the interesting features of the
ruin.&nbsp; At an early hour the following morning we sallied
from our inn, and, crossing the Wye, were greeted with a new
effect of the abbey.&nbsp; Majestically towering above encircling
trees, the external elevation arose in nearly its original
grandeur.&nbsp; The walk, though clad with moss and tender
lichens, appeared nowhere dismantled; yet might an eye, anxious
after picturesque forms, be offended with the uniform angles and
strait lines of the gable ends and parapets.&nbsp; We walked
along the banks of the sinuous river about half a mile from the
ferry, when the ruin presented itself in a very agreeable point
of view.&nbsp; Looking full through the grand aperture of the
eastern window, the rows of columns and <a
name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>arches,
overhung with clustering ivy, wore the appearance of a delightful
grove; and at the end of the perspective, the elegant tracery of
the opposite window, besprinkled with verdure, was well defined;
and in its distant tint had an admirable effect.&nbsp; These
views of the mouldering abbey, combined with the wild scenery of
the Wye, and the kindred gloom of a lowering atmosphere, were
truly impressive and grand; yet they scarcely excited such
sensations of awful sublimity as we felt on our first visit to
the interior of the ruin.</p>
<p>In our different walks between the inn and the abbey, we were
regularly beset with importunities for alms: the labouring man
abandoned his employment and the house-wife her family at the
sight of a stranger, to obtain a few pence by debasing
clamour.&nbsp; This system of begging we found to arise from the
late distresses, particularly that of the preceding year, which,
bearing on the great class of the people with an almost
annihilating pressure, entitled them to the sympathy and
assistance of those whom fortune had blessed with prosperity:
they had strained their aching sinews to meet the exigence, <a
name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 271</span>yet their
utmost exertions proved inadequate to the means of support.&nbsp;
Thus situated, alms or outrage formed their alternate resources;
but, happily, in the benevolence of the affluent they found an
asylum.&nbsp; This pressure was fast withdrawing, but its effects
remained; they had tasted the sweets of indolence, of support
without exertion; they no longer felt the dignity of independance
(for the odium of begging was withdrawn by invincible necessity);
and they continued the unworthy trade without remorse.&nbsp;
Excepting a few significant curtsies in the manufactories of
Neath, this was the first instance of the sort that we met with
during our tour.&nbsp; In other places, industry was urged to its
highest exertion; here, by an increased weight of necessity, it
sunk beneath the pressure.</p>
<p>The iron-works of Tintern I believe to be almost the only
concern in the neighbourhood of Wales where the old method of
fusing the ore by charcoal furnaces continues to be
practised.&nbsp; The manufacture is pursued to the forming of
fine wire and plates.</p>
<p>The mineral wealth of this district was not unknown to the
ancients; for large quantities <a name="page272"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 272</span>of scoria imperfectly separated from
the metal, which are evidently the refuse of Roman bloomeries,
and many furnaces whose origin no tradition reaches, appear in
several parts of the country.&nbsp; These Roman cinders have been
in many places reworked, according to modern improvements in
metallurgy, and made to yield a considerable portion of
metal.&nbsp; The decline of the ancient works is justly
attributed to their exhausting the forests which formerly
overspread Wales, for charcoal, until they were at length
entirely stopped for want of fuel.&nbsp; But within this half
century, coke made from pit-coal, which possesses the essential
principles of charcoal, has been applied with success to the
fusing of ore: in consequence, very numerous iron-mines have been
opened; and, aided by an inexhaustible supply of coals, their
produce has exceeded even the sanguine hopes of the
projectors.&nbsp; It must, however, be remarked, that iron made
with pit-coal is of inferior tenacity and ductility to that
manufactured by means of charcoal.&nbsp; Whether this arises from
a radical defect in the material used, from a too prodigal use of
calcareous earth to facilitate the flux of <a
name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 273</span>the metal,
or any other cause, remains yet to be determined.</p>
<p>I cannot take leave of Tintern without mentioning a
circumstance for the benefit of those tourists who may have an
obstinate beard, or a too pliant skin.&nbsp; Having dispatched an
attendant for a barber on my arriving at the inn, a blacksmith
was forthwith introduced, who proved to be the only shaver in the
village.&nbsp; The appearance of this man, exhibiting, with all
the sootiness of his employment, his brawny black arms bare to
the shoulders, did not flatter me with hopes of a very mild
operation; nor were they increased upon his producing a razor
that for massiveness might have served a Polypheme.&nbsp; I sat
down, however, and was plentifully besmeared with suds; after
which he endeavoured to supply the deficiency of an edge, by
exerting his ponderous strength in three or four such scrapes as,
without exciting my finer feelings, drew more tears into my eyes,
than might have sufficed for a modern comedy.&nbsp; I waited for
no more; but, releasing myself from his gripe, determined to pass
for a Jew Rabbi, rather than undergo the penance of any more
shaving at Tintern.</p>
<p><a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 274</span>We
crossed the Wye from Tintern, that we might follow the beauties
of the river in our way to Monmouth; then ascending a precipitous
wild-wooded hill, we took a farewel view of our much-loved abbey,
and soon looked down on the old village of <span
class="smcap">Tintern</span>, delightfully placed on the opposite
bank of the Wye, and dignified with the ruin of the Abbot&rsquo;s
mansion. <a name="citation274"></a><a href="#footnote274"
class="citation">[274]</a>&nbsp; Upon completing our descent in
traversing the hill, we entered the irregular village of <span
class="smcap">Brook&rsquo;s Weir</span>, off which a number of
sloops of from 80 to 100 tons were at anchor: these vessels were
waiting for their cargoes from Hereford and Monmouth, which are
brought hither in flat-bottomed barges, as the tide flows no
higher than this place.&nbsp; We had now a delightful ride for
several miles over meadows and pastures that skirted the Wye;
whose majestic stream, almost filling the narrow valley,
reflected the inclosing hills from its surface in a style of
inimitable beauty; while the rich ascending woods on either side
threw a softened light on the translucent river and <a
name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>its verdant
margin; so sweetly in harmony with the pleasing solitude of the
scene, as might dispose even revelry itself to fall in love with
retirement:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;O blest retirement, friend to life&rsquo;s
decline,<br />
Retreat from care, that never must be mine:<br />
How blest is he, who crowns, in shades like these,<br />
A youth of labour with an age of ease!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>About four miles above Tintern the rural little village of
<span class="smcap">Landago</span> saluted us with its white
church and cottages, glistening through encircling trees, as it
skirted the river and climbed the side of a lofty hill.&nbsp; We
then followed a gentle curvature of the Wye to Bigg&rsquo;s Weir,
a ridge of rocks which cross the river, leaving only a small
interval for the current.&nbsp; A string of barges was
unravelling its course in this strait as we were passing; which
task seemed to engage all the vigilance and activity of the
watermen.&nbsp; Near this spot the house (an ordinary mansion)
and grounds of General Rooke, member for the county of Monmouth,
occupying part of the river&rsquo;s bank, obliged us to make a
short deviation; but, soon returning to our limpid stream, we
caught a glimpse of the church and castle of St. Briavel,
crowning an eminence in the <a name="page276"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 276</span>forest of Dean just behind us; and
in front, a short distance beyond the opposite bank, appeared the
decaying importance of Pilson-house.</p>
<p>The narrow stripe of meadow-land that accompanies the Wye from
Brook&rsquo;s Weir to Monmouth, and in which our road lay, now
became frequently shut up from public convenience by fences
crossing the tract, and styles, in the place of open gates, which
the farmers had lately erected.&nbsp; We were therefore obliged
to climb up the forest-clothed hills, of almost inaccessible
steepness, driving our horses before us, and scrambling through
bush and briar; and only regained the meadows to encounter a
succeeding difficulty of the same kind.&nbsp; But our last was
the greatest; for, pursuing a track broken through a
closely-woven thicket that led over the hills, we neglected a
doubtful opening in the brambles that indicated our road, and
only guessed that we were wrong from the tedious height we were
climbing.&nbsp; We had, however, gone too far to retreat; and
therefore hoped, in the true spirit of error, as we had certainly
missed the right path, that by proceeding boldly on we might
extricate ourselves by <a name="page277"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 277</span>another.&nbsp; At length we reached
the top of the hill, and with no small disappointment beheld our
track terminate at a lonely farm-house; where no one appeared to
give us information; nor was any road whatever viable for the
pursuit of our journey.&nbsp; Yet the view that this eminence
commanded over the sinuous Wye, sweeping among sloping meadows,
woods, and precipices, in some sort repaid our fatigue.&nbsp;
Obliged to return, we forced a passage through tangled underwood
to the margin of the river, which here forming an extensive reach
between deep shelving banks, was thrown into one grand
shadow.&nbsp; The evening was drawing to a close; and the
retiring sun, no longer wantoning on the wavy current, sparingly
glittered on the woody treasures of its marginal heights, but
glared in full splendour on the distant hills; nor was a
brilliant sky wanting to contrast the <i>sombre</i> solemnity of
our vale:</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The
evening clouds,<br />
Lucid or dusk with flamy purple edg&rsquo;d,<br />
Float in gay pomp the blue horizon round;<br />
Amusive, changeful, shifting into shapes<br />
Of visionary beauty; antique towers<br />
With shadowy domes and pinnacles adorn&rsquo;d;<br />
Or hills of white extent, that rise and sink<br />
As sportive fancy lists.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>In
this shady silent retreat we passed about a mile, and emerged on
the village of <span class="smcap">Redbrook</span>, where several
groupes employed in some iron and tin works, and in plying a
ferry, gave animation to the scene.&nbsp; From this place,
following a bold curve of the river, and skirting the base of the
lofty Kymin, we soon came within view of Monmouth; the remarkably
high spire of its church; and the large old Mansion of Troy, in a
low situation, a small distance to the left, near the junction of
the Trothy with the Wye.</p>

<p>Monmouth is delightfully situated in a gently undulating
valley; chiefly in a high state of cultivation, surrounded by
high hills: it occupies a sort of peninsula formed by the conflux
of the Wye and the Monnow; so that it is nearly incircled by the
two rivers.&nbsp; The town is extensive, and contains many good
houses; particularly in a principal broad street, which extends
from the market-place to an old British or Saxon bridge and
gateway over the Monnow.&nbsp; The market-place, with <a
name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 280</span>the
town-hall over it, is a handsome building; but sadly disfigured
by an awkward statue of Henry the Fifth, which, no doubt, was
intended to ornament it.&nbsp; From this part a narrow street
leads to St. Mary&rsquo;s church, which is also a handsome modern
edifice, chiefly remarkable for its grand lofty spire rising 200
feet from the foundation; the tower of which affords an
interesting view of the surrounding districts.&nbsp; This
structure is engrafted upon a Gothic church that belonged to an
Alien Benedictine priory of Black Monks, which was founded in the
reign of Henry the First, and dedicated to the Holy Virgin.&nbsp;
The priory-house forms a large family residence belonging to Adam
Williams, Esq.; and contains an apartment which the legend of the
place declares to have been the library of the celebrated
Geoffery of Monmouth; but the style of the building is by no
means so ancient as the time of Geoffery, who, we find, was
consecrated bishop of St. Asaph in 1152.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The chronicle of Briton&rsquo;s kings<br />
From Brute to Arthur&rsquo;s rayne,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>written by Geoffery, has long excited the attention and
controversy of the leaned: by <a name="page281"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 281</span>some it is implicitly believed; and
rejected, as altogether fabulous, by others.&nbsp; The moderate
opinion here, as in most other cases, is the best: this views it
as founded on authentic documents, although distorted by monkish
superstition and tricks, and a taste for the marvellous.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Monmouth Castle</span>, situated on the
banks of the Monnow in the northern part of the town, exhibits
few memorials of its former extent and magnificence in its
present very dilapidated state; and the remaining fragments lose
much of their characteristic dignity from the bricky appearance
given by the red grit stone of which they are constructed.&nbsp;
Among these broken walls are shewn, with no small degree of
exultation, traces of the chamber in which Henry the Fifth, the
glory of Monmouth, was born.&nbsp; Adjoining to this is the ruin
of a large apartment, sixty-three feet long by forty-six wide,
which was probably the baronial hall, and in latter times formed
the court of the Assizes.&nbsp; Other vestiges of the castle are
evident among stables and out-houses: some vaults under the house
of Mr. Cecil of the Dyffrin, are of <a name="page282"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 282</span>the oldest character, and may be
attributed to Saxon if not to Roman workmanship.</p>
<p>The general building of this castle (though of very remote
foundation) may be considered as posterior to the Civil wars in
the third Henry&rsquo;s reign; when, we learn, the castle of
Monmouth was taken and rased to the ground by Simon Montford,
Earl of Leicester.&nbsp; A large mansion on the site of the
castle, built with its materials, and engrafted on its ruins, is
now occupied as a ladies&rsquo; boarding-school.&nbsp; Soon after
the erection of this house, a Marchioness of Worcester went
thither to lie-in of her first child, at the instance of her
grandfather, Henry, first Duke of Beaufort, who was anxious that
his descendant should draw his first breath &ldquo;near the same
spot of ground and space of air, where our great hero Henry the
Fifth was born.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Near the extremity of the town, by the side of the Monnow, is
the county goal, a new massive stone building, which in its plan,
regulations, and superintendance, does high credit to the pubic
spirit of the county.&nbsp; Without the town, at the foot of the
Monnow-bridge, is St. Thomas&rsquo;s church, a curious <a
name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 283</span>old
structure which is supposed to have been built by the Saxons.</p>
<p>Monmouth is supposed by Mr. Horsley to have been a Roman
station, the Blestium of Antoninus.&nbsp; It is a borough and
corporate town, governed by a mayor, and contains about six
hundred houses, and two thousand six hundred inhabitants.&nbsp;
Woollen caps were the staple manufacture of Monmouth when that
article was in general use; and Shakspeare&rsquo;s Fluellen
alludes to this fashion: &ldquo;If your Majesty is remembered of
it, the Welchmen did goot service in a garden where leeks did
grow, wearing leeks in their Monmouth caps.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the
town has now no manufacture, although there are some iron and tin
works in the neighbourhood: its commerce depends on the
navigation of the Wye, in the distribution of goods between
Bristol, Hereford, and adjoining districts.&nbsp; Yet no small
part of its thriving appearance may be attributed to the numerous
gentry that are induced to fix their residence here from the
pleasantness of the situation.</p>
<p>Chippenham meadow, an agreeable plain, inclosed by the town,
the Wye, and the Monnow, is the general rendezvous of Gwentonian
<a name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 284</span>beauty
on summer (and particularly on Sunday) evenings.&nbsp; We had the
good fortune to be in Monmouth on a Sunday, and of course did not
neglect to join the promenade; where many a squire of little
manors eyed us with much more inquiry than cordiality.&nbsp;
Their dulcineas,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Healthful and strong, full as the summer
rose<br />
Blown by prevailing suns,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>displayed the vigour of youth and Wales, and possessed decided
points of feminine attraction.&nbsp; But who would leave London
to describe female beauty?</p>
<p>In the vicinity of Monmouth is a remarkably high hill, called
the <span class="smcap">Kymin</span>, which rises from the banks
of the Wye, on the Gloucestershire side of the river.&nbsp; A
pleasant walk is traced to its summit, from which a wonderful
range of prospect extends to a circumference of near three
hundred miles.&nbsp; It would be tedious to enumerate the
multifarious objects that present themselves in this great
prospect: if any one be eminently beautiful, it is the
diversified undulating vale of Monmouth, enlivened by its
picturesque town and spire, and watered by the Wye, <a
name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 285</span>the Monnow,
and the Trothy, limpidly meandering through fertile hollows, and
at length uniting, in the course of the former river, at the foot
of the hill.&nbsp; At the top of the Kymin, a handsome pavilion
has been lately erected for the accommodation of parties; its
summit is also adorned with a rich wood called Beaulieu grove,
which, descending over part of its precipitous sides, forms its
proudest ornament.&nbsp; Several walks cut through the wood
terminate at the brow of steep declivities, commanding great and
enchanting views; and which in the spring, as I am told, from the
universality of apple orchards in this district, are as singular
as they are beautiful.</p>
<p>There are several antique mansions in the neighbourhood of
Monmouth that deserve notice.&nbsp; About a mile from the town,
on the left of the road to Raglan, is <span
class="smcap">Wonastow-house</span>, formerly a residence of a
branch of the Herbert family, <a name="citation285"></a><a
href="#footnote285" class="citation">[285]</a> which is
conjectured to have been built about the reign of Henry the
Sixth.&nbsp; Its situation, on a gentle eminence <a
name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 286</span>commanding
many extensive views, is extremely pleasant; and the surrounding
farm-lands still bear traces of its park in several groves of
ancient oaks and elms.&nbsp; The edifice, though much diminished
in extent and divided into two distinct habitations, is still a
venerable relic of the times, and contains several original
family portraits.&nbsp; The old chapel belonging to the mansion
is now applied to domestic use.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Treowen</span>, situated about a mile
further westward, to the north of the road to Raglan, was once a
splendid mansion, built by Inigo Jones, and which belonged to
another scion from the Herbert stock.&nbsp; The position of the
house and grounds, now laid out in a farm, is very delightful,
watered by the meandering Trothy, and still exhibiting a
profusion of rich woods.&nbsp; Though occupied as a farmhouse,
and much reduced in dimensions, the mansion continues to shew
many marks of its ancient grandeur, in the spacious and
decorative style of the apartments, a noble staircase of oak, and
its ornamented porch.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Troy-house</span>, standing within a mile
south-east of Monmouth, near the road to Chepstow, was a
residence of a further ramification <a name="page287"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 287</span>of the prolific Herbert race. <a
name="citation287"></a><a href="#footnote287"
class="citation">[287]</a>&nbsp; Part of the ancient residence is
visible in a Gothic gateway; but the house is of a later date,
its erection being, as well as the preceding, attributed to Inigo
Jones.&nbsp; Neither the house, though extensive, nor its
situation, in a hollow near the river Trothy, possess any claim
to admiration.&nbsp; Throughout the apartments a large collection
of family pictures is arranged, which contains the portraits of
many distinguished characters, but very few specimens of fine
painting.&nbsp; In the housekeeper&rsquo;s room is a curious oak
chimney-piece, <a name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
288</span>brought from Raglan Castle, carved with scriptural
subjects; and in a room on the third floor is another ancient
chimney-piece inlaid with mother-of-pearl, and curiously
ornamented with devices of Love and Plenty.</p>
<p>About three miles further on the road to Chepstow is the
village of <span class="smcap">Trelech</span>, which is supposed
to have derived its name from three druidical stones standing in
a field adjoining the road, near the church.&nbsp; They are
placed upright, or rather inclining; of different heights,
varying between ten and fifteen feet; and the exterior stones are
the one fourteen, and the other twenty feet distant from the
middle pillar: their substance is a concretion of silicious
pebbles in a calcareous bed, commonly called pudding-stone, and
of which some neighbouring rocks consist.&nbsp; This monument of
antiquity is considered to have been the supporting part of a
cromlech; but the stones being so far asunder invalidates the
conjecture.&nbsp; Various large masses of the same sort of stone
in the vicinity of Trelech seem to indicate the remains of other
works of the same kind.</p>
<p>In the village, inclosed by a garden, is an earthen mound four
hundred and fifty feet <a name="page289"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 289</span>in diameter, encircled by a moat,
and connected with extensive entrenchments; which is imagined to
have been a Roman work, and afterwards to have been the site of a
castle belonging to the Earls of Clare.&nbsp; The village is also
remarkable for a chalybeate well that was formerly much
attended.&nbsp; Near the church, which deserves to be noticed for
the agreeable proportions of its Gothic members and its handsome
spire, is a pedestal with a sun-dial, supposed to be of high
antiquity: it bears a Latin inscription, commemorating
Harold&rsquo;s victory over the Britons.&nbsp; Large quantities
of iron scoria, scattered over the fields near the village, are
generally allowed to indicate that a Roman bloomery was
established near the spot.</p>
<p>From this place the road soon ascends the Devaudon height,
traverses a tract of forest called Chepstow Park, and in the
course of its progress embraces several superb and extensive
views; in which the varieties of the Wye, of hanging woods, wild
heathy mountains, and rich inclosures, rise in succession.</p>
<p>We made an excursion from Monmouth, on the road to Hereford,
as far as Grosmont.&nbsp; Proceeding through a charming country
about <a name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
290</span>three miles, we struck off on the right to visit <span
class="smcap">Perthir</span>, a very ancient seat of the Herbert
family.&nbsp; Of the castellated mansion, surrounded by a moat
and two drawbridges, few vestiges appear in the present
diminished and patched-up building; yet some marks of former
magnificence meet the observer, in a long vaulted hall, with a
music gallery at the end, a large Gothic window with stone
compartments, and the massive oak beams of a long passage.&nbsp;
The extensive manors that were attached to Perthir, and which, as
tradition relates, extended from thence to Ross, now exhibit but
a sorry remnant of past opulence.</p>
<p>Mr. Lorimer, the present possessor of the estate, and a
descendant of the Herberts by the female line, merrily relates an
anecdote rising out of a contest for precedence between the
houses of Perthir and Werndee; and which, it has been remarked,
was carried on with as much inveteracy as that between the houses
of York and Lancaster, and was only perhaps less bloody, as they
had not the power of sacrificing the lives of thousands in their
foolish quarrel.&nbsp; Mr. Proger, of Werndee, in company with a
friend, <a name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
291</span>returning from Monmouth to his home, was suddenly
overtaken by a violent storm; and, unable to proceed, groped his
way for refuge to his cousin Powell&rsquo;s, at Perthir.&nbsp;
The family was retired to rest; but the loud calls of the
tempest-beaten travellers soon brought Mr. Powell to a window;
and a few words informed him of his relation&rsquo;s predicament;
requesting a night&rsquo;s lodging: &ldquo;What! is it you,
cousin Proger? you and your friend shall be instantly
admitted;&mdash;but upon one condition, that you will never
dispute with me hereafter upon my being the head of the
family.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; returned Mr. Proger,
&ldquo;were it to rain swords and daggers, I would drive this
night to Werndee; rather than lower the consequence of my
family.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here a string of arguments was brought
forward on each side; which however interesting to the parties,
would prove very trifling in relation; and which, like all other
contests grounded in prejudice and proceeded in with petulance;
but served to fix both parties more firmly in their errors.&nbsp;
They parted in the bitterest enmity; and the stranger, who had
silently waited the issue of the contest, in vain solicited a
shelter from <a name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
292</span>the storm; for he was a friend of cousin
Proger&rsquo;s!</p>
<p>Leaving Perthir, we soon passed through the little village of
Newcastle, which derives its name from a castle that may still be
traced in an earthen mound 300 feet in circumference, and some
intrenchments, but whose history no tradition reaches.&nbsp; This
barrow, and an ancient oak of extraordinary size, are considered
by the superstitious neighbourhood to be under the immediate
protection of spirits and fairies, and to form the scene of their
nocturnal revels.&nbsp; A spring near the village is deemed
miraculous in the cure of rheumatic and other disorders.</p>
<p>Within a mile from this place we struck off the turnpike
towards <span class="smcap">Screnfrith Castle</span>, situated on
the banks of the Monnow, in a sequestered spot environed by high
hills.&nbsp; This fortress is of the simplest construction; its
area, of a trapezium form, is merely surrounded by a curtain wall
with circular towers covering each angle, and a demi-turret
projecting from the middle of one side.&nbsp; Near the centre of
the area is a juliet, or high round tower, upon a mound, which
formed the keep, the door and window apertures of <a
name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 293</span>which are
circularly arched; but the exterior walls of the castle appear to
have been originally only furnished with oilets or chinks for
shooting arrows through.&nbsp; Encumbered by the lowly
habitations of a poor village, it has little claim to picturesque
merit from most points of view; but on the opposite side of the
Monnow, combined with a Gothic bridge of two arches crossing the
stream, it forms a pleasing picture.&nbsp; Screnfrith Castle is
allowed to be the oldest in Monmouthshire; it is certainly of
British erection, and is probably of as remote antiquity as any
in Wales.</p>
<p>Screnfrith, Grosmont, and White Castles, formerly defended the
lordship of Overwent; which, extending from the Wye to the Usk,
nearly comprised the whole northern portion of
Monmouthshire.&nbsp; This tract of country, with its castles,
fell into the hands of Brian Fitz Count, Earl of Hereford, who
came over with the Conqueror; but soon deviated from his family,
and was afterwards seized by Henry the Third, and conferred on
his favourite Hubert de Burgh.&nbsp; Upon the disgrace of that
virtuous and able minister, the capricious monarch granted the
three castles <a name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
294</span>to his son the Earl of Lancaster; and, with Caldecot
castle, they still remain annexed to the dutchy.</p>
<p>The continuance of our journey to Grossmont, wandering in an
irriguous valley among bye-lanes that were scarcely passable,
although it proved very tedious in travelling, afforded us a
succession of the most pleasing retired scenes imaginable.&nbsp;
On our right a diversity of swells and hollows, variously clad in
wild woods or cultivation, extended throughout our ride, where
the lively and transparent Monnow, illumined by</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The
noon-tide beams<br />
Which sparkling dances on the trembling stream,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>serpentized its current in endless variety.&nbsp; Immediately
on our left, the Graig, a huge solitary mountain, reared its
towering sides from the low lands in uncontended majesty, and
accompanied our road to the pleasing little village of <span
class="smcap">Grosmont</span>.</p>
<p>This place stands at the north-eastern limit of Monmouthshire,
in an agreeable undulating valley, diversified with wood and
pasture, and beautifully accompanied by the meandering Monnow,
here wantoning its <a name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
295</span>most fantastic course.&nbsp; On an eminence near the
village, and swelling above the river, is the picturesque ruin of
its castle; a pile of no great extent, but well disposed, and
profusely decorated with shrubs and ivy.&nbsp; The form of the
structure is irregular: large circular towers cover the angles of
the ramparts; within which are traces of the baronial hall, and
other apartments, and beyond the mount are some remains of the
barbican, or redoubt, and several entrenchments.&nbsp; All the
door and window arches are pointed Gothic, and of the proportion
in use about the thirteenth century; but the foundation of the
castle is supposed to be coeval with that of
Screnfrith&rsquo;s.&mdash;Grosmont church is a large Gothic
structure, built in the form of a Roman cross; and, with its
octagon tower, and high tapering spire, is a conspicuous ornament
to the village.</p>
<p>Though now an insignificant cluster of habitations, Grosmont
was formerly a town of some note.&nbsp; Many exterior traces of
buildings, and raised causeways, constructed like Roman roads
with large blocks of stone, diverging from it, prove its antique
extent and importance to have been considerable: nor <a
name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 296</span>is the
legend of the place deficient in asserting its quondam
consequence.</p>
<p>But with still higher interest, with more voluble earnestness,
the natives recount the exploits of their reputed necromancer,
<span class="smcap">John of Kent</span>.&nbsp; Among a thousand
other instances of his magical skill, they confidently assure
you, that when he was a boy, being ordered to protect some corn
from the birds, he conjured all the crows in the neighbourhood
into a barn without a roof, and by force of his incantations
obliged them to remain there while he visited Grosmont
fair.&nbsp; A greater service that he performed for the country
was, his building the bridge over the Monnow in one night by the
agency of one of his familiars.&nbsp; Long did his strange
actions frighten men out of their wits; and at length, dying, he
outwitted the devil; for, in consideration of services while
living, he agreed to surrender himself to his satanic majesty
after his death, whether he was buried in or out of church; but,
by ordering his body to be interred under the church wall, he
contrived to slip out of the contract.&nbsp; A stone in the
church-yard, near the chancel, <a name="page297"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 297</span>is said to mark the spot of this
interment.</p>
<p>Higher tradition relates, that this extraordinary-personage
was a monk, who, possessing a greater knowledge in natural
philosophy than could at that time be generally comprehended, was
reputed a sorcerer.&nbsp; The family of the Scudamores, at
Kentchurch-house, about a mile from Grosmont, where he became
domesticated, had a Latin translation of the Bible written by him
on vellum, but which is now lost.&nbsp; An ancient painting of
him upon wood is, however, preserved in the mansion; and a cellar
in the house is described to have been the stable of his horses;
steeds of no vulgar pedigree, which carried him through the air
with more than the speed of witches.</p>
<p>From a collation of different legends and circumstances,
several respectable enquirers are inclined to believe, that this
necromancer was no other than the famous Owen Glendower; who,
after his defeat, and the dispersion of his army, concealed
himself in the disguise of a bard, or wizard.&nbsp; A strong
circumstance which favours this conjecture is, <a
name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 298</span>that the
daughter of Glendower married a Scudamore, who at the time
occupied Kentchurch-house.&nbsp; It may also be remarked, that
neither the time of the chief&rsquo;s death, nor the place of his
sepulture, were ever positively ascertained.</p>
<p>Upon our return to Monmouth from this excursion, we had the
good fortune to fall into the company of Mr. Wathen of Hereford,
the benefit of whose local information and obliging assiduities
has been felt by numerous tourists, as well as ourselves.&nbsp;
This gentleman pointed out the most striking beauties of the Wye
toward Ross; and of his directions we gladly availed ourselves
the following morning, when we bade adieu to Wales and
Monmouthshire.&nbsp; But, as it is my object to effect a general
delineation of that tract of country, I shall not hesitate to
break the thread of my tour, and suspend a description of the
Wye&rsquo;s scenery and some further continuance of our route,
while I traverse the north-western part of Monmouthshire, and the
eastern frontier of South-Wales, which yet remains
unexplored.&nbsp; In this part of my work, I must describe <a
name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 299</span>things as
they appeared to me six years since, when I visited this portion
of country in my return from a tour through the North of England
and Wales, assisted by the best documents and observations that I
have since been able to procure.</p>

300</span>CHAP. XIX.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">ABBEY OF GRACE-DIEU&mdash;SIR DAVID
GAM&mdash;WHITE CASTLE&mdash;ABERGAVENNY HILLS&mdash;THE TOWN,
CASTLE, AND CHURCH.</p>
<p>Within a short distance southward of the road from Monmouth to
Abergavenny, and about three miles from the first-mentioned town,
are the small remains of the abbey of <span
class="smcap">Grace-dieu</span>, chiefly formed into a barn,
situated on a sequestered bank of the Trothy.&nbsp; A farm on the
opposite side of the river was the park belonging to the abbey;
and hence it is called Parc-gras-dieu farm; the house of which is
built on the ruins of the ancient lodge.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Llandilo Cresseney</span>, the seat of
Richard Lewis, Esq.; pleasingly situated in a rich undulating
country to the south of the road, about half way to Abergavenny,
is a modern <a name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
301</span>house built on the site of an ancient mansion of the
Powells.&nbsp; The position commands an interesting prospect of
the neighbouring country; and in the home view the church of
Llandilo, with its high spire, forms a picturesque and leading
object.&nbsp; In an adjoining field, belonging to a farm that was
formerly the red-deer park of Raglan castle, is the site of Old
Court, once the residence of the celebrated Sir David Gam, not
less known for his courageous report upon having reconnoitred the
enemy before the battle of Agincourt (&ldquo;An&rsquo;t please
you, my liege, there are enough to be kilted, enough to run away,
and enough to be taken prisoners&rdquo;) than for his valorous
achievements and preservation of the king&rsquo;s life in the
encounter, though at the expence of his own.&nbsp; The dukes of
Beaufort and the earls of Pembroke are descended from Gladys, one
of his numerous progeny, which tradition has by no means
curtailed; for it is asserted, that his children formed a line
reaching from his house to the church.</p>
<p>The ruins of <span class="smcap">White Castle</span> are very
considerable, crowning the summit of a ridgy eminence a mile and
a half to the north of <a name="page302"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 302</span>Llandilo.&nbsp; Their figure is
irregular; flanked by six circular towers, which, with the
ramparts, are pierced with oilets.&nbsp; Two advancing massive
towers guard the entrance, which was provided with a portcullis
and drawbridge, and rendered still more formidable by an
uncommonly large outwork beyond the moat, which is remarkably
deep.&nbsp; This ruin is from every point of view imposing and
grand; but its ponderous unornamented towers, and its lofty
battlements, whose dark colour is rendered still more dismal by
the broad shadows of impendent foliage, rather conspire to raise
an image of baronical haughtiness and oppression, than of its
show and hospitality; yet, in the time of Elizabeth, Churchyard
describes it to be</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A statelie seate, a loftie princelie
place,<br />
Whose beautie gives the simple soyle some grace.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the architecture of this castle I should suppose its
antiquity to be at least coeval with the first settlement of the
Normans in Gwent, if not even more remote.&nbsp; Its history is
common with that of Screnfrith and Grosmont; but over both these
it holds a decided superiority in extent, and massiveness of
construction.</p>
<p><a name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 303</span>On
approaching <span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span>, the
tourist&rsquo;s attention is involuntarily arrested by the
singular beauty and variety of interest which the spot embraces,
particularly in its encircling hills.&nbsp; The road skirting the
Little Skyridd, a well-formed hill richly laid out in wood and
pasture, opens to a fine display of the vale of Usk beneath; on
the opposite side of which the continuous ridge of the wild
Pontypool hills, which form the western boundary of the county,
terminate in the heathy high-swelling Blorenge: a tract of wood
sweeps along its base, and mixes with the sylvan knoll of
Lanfoist, decorating its northern extremity.&nbsp; Further to the
right, the elegant smooth cone of the Sugar-loaf, the highest of
the Monmouthshire mountains, presents itself, issuing from among
the four tributary eminences of the Pen-y-vale hills.&nbsp;
Eastward of this mountain is the Great Skyridd, an object of
considerable interest; its bipartite and truly Alpine summit,
without being a forced opposition, strikingly contrasts the
general undulating line of the neighbouring hills, and rears a
distinct and noble character on the scene.&nbsp; The views from
this mountain are scarcely inferior to <a
name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 304</span>those from
the Sugar-loaf; while its craggy form, its asperitous summit,
jagged into an immense fissure, and shelving to a ridge apex of
fearful narrowness, impress a mixed emotion of awe and admiration
on the adventurous climber of the height, that more than
compensates for a small inferiority of altitude.&nbsp; There was
formerly, at the top of this mountain, a Roman Catholic chapel
dedicated to St. Michael, of which no vestiges remain; but a
remembrance of the site is preserved in a hollow place formed by
the superstitious, who, resorting here on Michaelmas eve, carry
away the earth to strew over the sepulchres of their
friends.&nbsp; According to the barometrical measurement of
General Roy, the height of the Sugar-loaf mountain is 1852 feet
perpendicular above the Gavenny rivulet, near its junction with
the Usk.&nbsp; The Blorenge is 1720, and the Great Skyridd 1498
feet from the same level.</p>
<p>The expansive bases of these mountains, nearly approximating,
descend to a finely-wooded fertile valley; through which the
river Usk, rushing from a majestic portal of wood, winds in a
bright translucid stream, with all the impetuosity of its
mountain <a name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
305</span>character.&nbsp; At the foot of one of the confederated
hills sustaining the towering cone of the Sugar-loaf, which
gently inclines to the river, <span
class="smcap">Abergavenny</span> is situated; a straggling
irregular town, pleasingly interspersed with trees, but deriving
its highest attraction from the charms of its position.</p>
<p>Upon an eminence above the river, near the southern extremity
of the town, is the ruined castle, which in its present state
exhibits very few memorials of former magnificence.&nbsp; The
gate-house, or principal entrance, is tolerably entire, and
vestiges of two courts may be traced among the broken walls; but
of the citadel no traces remain, although an intrenched mound
close to the ruins evidently marks its site.&nbsp; The town was
also fortified, and many portions of the work remain,
particularly Tudor&rsquo;s gate, the western entrance, furnished
with two portcullisses, and remarkable for the beautifully
composed landscape seen through it.&nbsp; This castle is said to
have been built by a giant named Agros: without contending for
the accuracy of this tradition, however, it is certain, that the
principal part was erected <a name="page306"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 306</span>by the Normans upon the site of a
British fortress.</p>
<p>In the twelfth century some native forces, headed by Sitfylt
ap Dyfnwald, a Welch prince, assailed this castle, and took
prisoners the Anglo-Norman garrison, with their chief,
William-de-Braose, lord of Brecon.&nbsp; William being, upon an
adjustment of differences, reinstated in his possessions, invited
Sitfylt, his son Geoffery, and other chieftains of Gwent, to a
great feast at Abergavenny Castle, where they were all
treacherously murdered: he then surprised Sitfylt&rsquo;s house,
and slew his other son, Cadwallader, in the presence of his
mother.&nbsp; This barbarity did not escape punishment.&nbsp;
William, flying his country, died a wretched wanderer at Paris;
and his wife and son were famished in Windsor Castle.&nbsp; The
fate of his grandson, Reginald, may also be considered in the
light of a retribution: Llewelyn prince of Wales, suspecting him,
as Dugdale relates, &ldquo;of over much familiarity with his
wife,&rdquo; subtilly invited him to an eastern feast; and
towards the close of the banquet, charging him with the act,
threw him into prison, where he suffered <a
name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 307</span>a violent
death, together with the adultress.&nbsp; In 1273, we find the
country of Overwent, including the castle of Abergavenny, in the
possession of John de Hastings, a very pink of chivalry.&nbsp; A
succession of valorous knights inherited this domain; but Richard
Earl of Warwick, who became lord of Abergavenny in the
commencement of the fifteenth century, surpassed them all, and
even John himself, in military fame, and manners debonnair: he
signalized himself in tournaments at most of the courts in
Europe, and obtained the honourable appellation of &ldquo;the
father of courtesy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The church is a large Gothic structure, and appears to have
been built in the form of a Roman cross, but is now curtailed of
its transepts; at the juncture of one of them, a circular arch,
now filled up, wears a Norman character, and seems to have been
part of the original building.&nbsp; Three arches, curiously
dissimilar, separate the north aile from the nave.&nbsp; The
choir remains in its antique state, with stalls for a prior and
his monks, formed of oak, and rudely carved; and the ailes on
either side are furnished <a name="page308"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 308</span>with the monuments of several
illustrious personages.</p>
<p>On the north of the choir is the figure of a man in a coat of
mail, with a bull at his feet; supposed to be the monument of Sir
Edward Nevill, which is thus explained by Churchyard:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;His force was much; for he by strength<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; With bull did struggle so,<br />
He broke clean off his horns at length,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And therewith let him go.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the opposite side is the recumbent effigy of an armed
knight, his legs across, <a name="citation308"></a><a
href="#footnote308" class="citation">[308]</a> and his feet
resting on a greyhound.&nbsp; Of this the sexton&rsquo;s legend
relates, that the knight, returning home, saw his infant son
lying on the floor covered with blood, with his cradle overturned
at his side, and the hound standing by, with his mouth besmeared
with gore.&nbsp; Conceiving that the dog had attacked the child,
he instantly killed it; but soon discovered, that the blood
issued from a large serpent <a name="page309"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 309</span>that had writhed about the child,
and which this faithful animal had destroyed.</p>
<p>In the middle of the south aile of the choir, generally called
the Herberts&rsquo; chapel, is the effigy of Sir William ap
Thomas, and his wife Gladys, daughter of the celebrated Sir David
Gam.&nbsp; Beneath a handsome alabaster monument, at the further
end of the chapel, repose the ashes of Sir Richard Herbert, of
Coldbrook, and his wife.&nbsp; This Sir Richard, a younger son of
the just mentioned Sir William ap Thomas, was a man of gigantic
stature and uncommon strength.&nbsp; In the contest between the
houses of York and Lancaster, he with his brother the Earl of
Pembroke supported the White rose at the battle of Banbury, where
he was at length taken prisoner, and finally executed by the
successful faction; but not until he had passed and repassed
twice through the adverse army, killing with a pole-ax no less
than 140 men; which, his illustrious descendant and biographer,
lord Herbert of Cherbury, remarks, is more than is famed of
Amadis de Gaul, or the Knight of the Sun.&nbsp; The richest
monument in the church is that of Sir Richard Herbert of Ewias,
his nephew, <a name="page310"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
310</span>which occupies a recess in the south wall of the
chapel.</p>
<p>Before the dissolution of religious houses, this church
belonged to a priory of Benedictine monks, which was founded by
Hamelin Baladun, <a name="citation310"></a><a href="#footnote310"
class="citation">[310]</a> who is also said to have built the
castle.&nbsp; The priory house, adjoining the nave of the church,
is converted into a commodious dwelling, which was lately
tenanted by the Gunter and Milborne family.&nbsp; The free-school
in the town was founded by Henry the Eighth, and amply endowed
with the revenues of forfeited monasteries, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Abergavenny was a Roman town, the Gobannium of
Antoninus.&nbsp; Leland describes it to be &ldquo;a faire waulled
town, meately well inhabited;&rdquo; and an account of
Monmouthshire written in 1602 represents it as &ldquo;a fine
town, wealthy and thriving, and the very <a
name="page311"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 311</span>best in the
shire.&rdquo;&nbsp; But during the last century it was in a very
declining state until the establishment of some great iron-works,
which have lately sprung up in the adjacent mountains.&nbsp; When
full-bottomed flaxen wigs were the rage, the town enjoyed a
temporary prosperity from a method peculiar to its inhabitants of
bleaching hair; but, perriwigs being no longer the rage, the
place was hastening to decay: just at this juncture the faculty
proclaimed that goats-whey was a specific in consumptive cases;
and crowds of invalids, under the fiat of death, immediately
enlivened the town.&nbsp; But the fashions of doctors are no more
stationary than those of beaux; the <i>ton</i> for goats-whey
soon diminished; and, deprived of patients as well as perriwigs,
the place was relapsing into poverty and desertion, when the
fortunate discovery of the Blaenavon iron mines, (a grand concern
in the recesses of the Blorenge mountain well worth the
tourist&rsquo;s attention) gave a new face to the town, and still
daily encreases its population.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">WERNDEE&mdash;FAMILY PRIDE&mdash;LANTHONY
ABBEY&mdash;OLD CASTLE.</p>
<p>About two miles from Abergavenny is <span
class="smcap">Werndee</span>, a poor patched-up house: though
once a mansion of no less magnificence than antiquity, it is now
only interesting as being considered to have been the spot where
the prolific Herbert race was first implanted in Britain.&nbsp;
Henry de Herbert, chamberlain to king Henry the First, is
supposed to have been their great ancestor.&nbsp; Of the vast
possessions that formerly supported the grandeur of the Herberts,
the inheritance of Mr. Proger, the last lineal descendant from
the elder branch of this family, who died about twenty years
since, had dwindled to less than two hundred a year.&nbsp; Mr.
Coxe relates an anecdote of this gentleman&rsquo;s pride of
ancestry, <a name="page313"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
313</span>which may be compared with the remarks on Perthir; <a
name="citation313"></a><a href="#footnote313"
class="citation">[313]</a> at the same time, it conveys a brief
outline of the family&rsquo;s genealogy.</p>
<p>Mr. Proger accidentally met a stranger near his house, who
made various enquiries respecting the prospects and local objects
of the situation; and at length demanded, &ldquo;Pray, whose is
this antique mansion before us?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;That, Sir, is
Werndee: a very ancient house; for <i>out</i> of it <i>came</i>
the earls of Pembroke of the first line, and the earls of
Pembroke the second line; the lords Herbert of Cherbury, the
Herberts of Coldbrook, Rumney, Cardiff, and York; the Morgans of
Acton; the earl of Hunsdon; the Jones&rsquo;s of Treowen and
Lanarth, and all the Powells.&nbsp; <i>Out</i> of this house
also, by the female line, <i>came</i> the dukes of
Beaufort.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;And pray, Sir, who lives there
now?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I do, Sir.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Then
pardon me, Sir&mdash;do not lose sight of all these prudent
examples; but <i>come out</i> of it yourself; or &rsquo;twill
tumble and crush you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A principal excursion from Abergavenny is that which leads
northward to Lanthony <a name="page314"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 314</span>abbey, a majestic ruin seated in a
deep recess of the Black mountains, at the very extremity of the
county.&nbsp; The first part of the route lies through a romantic
pass between the Skyridd and Sugar-loaf mountains, upon the
Hereford turnpike.&nbsp; Proceeding about two miles, the church
of Landeilo Bertholly appears on the right; and not far from it
an antique mansion called the White-house, a residence of the
Floyers.&nbsp; Another ancient house occurs at the village of
Llanvihangel Crickhornell, seen through groves of firs, lately a
seat of the Arnolds, but now occupied as a farm-house.&nbsp; From
this spot a ditch-like road, almost impracticable for carriages,
strikes off among the mountains,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Through tangled forests, and through
dang&rsquo;rous ways,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>carried upon precipices impendent over the brawling torrent of
the Hondy.&nbsp; Sometimes the road opens to scenes of the most
romantic description, where, at an immense depth beneath, the
torrent is seen raging in a bed of rocks, and mountains of the
most imposing aspect rise from the valley,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The nodding horrors of whose shady brows<br
/>
Threat the forlorn and wand&rsquo;ring traveller.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
315</span>Immediately to the left of the road rises the Gaer, a
huge rocky hill crowned with an ancient encampment.&nbsp; On the
opposite side of the river, fearfully hanging on a steep cliff,
and beneath a menacing hill bristled with innumerable craigs, is
the romantic village of <span class="smcap">Cwmjoy</span>.&nbsp;
Landscapes of the boldest composition would be continual, but
that the road, formed into a deep hollow, and overtopped by
hedge-row elms, excludes the traveller from almost every view but
that of his embowered track.&nbsp; The pedestrian, however, is at
liberty, while ranging among heaths and fields above the road, to
enjoy the wild grandeur of the country, which will hardly fail to
repay him for his additional toil.</p>
<p>In the deep gloomy vale of Ewias, encircled by the barren
summits of the Black mountains, but enjoying some degree of local
cultivation, and enlivened by the crystalline Hondy, is situated
the ruin of <span class="smcap">Lanthony Abbey</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p315b.jpg">
<img alt=
"Lanthony Abbey"
title=
"Lanthony Abbey"
src="images/p315s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Venerable and grand, but wholly devoid of ornament, it
partakes of the character of the surrounding scenery.&nbsp; Not a
single tendril of ivy decorates the massive walls of the
structure, and but a sprinkling of shrubs and <a
name="page316"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 316</span>light
branchy trees fringe the high parapets, or shade the broken
fragments beneath.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Where rev&rsquo;rend shrines in Gothic
grandeur stood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The nettle or the noxious night-shade spreads;<br />
And ashlings, wafted from the neighbouring wood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the worn turrets wave their trembling
heads.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The area of the church is not very extensive; the length is
212 feet; the breadth 50; and it measures 100 across the
transepts.&nbsp; The roof has long since fallen in, and a great
part of the south wall is now a prostrate ruin; but the view
afforded of the interior, in consequence, is extremely grand and
picturesque.&nbsp; A double row of pointed arches, reposing on
massive piers, separate the side ailes from the nave; above
which, divided from the Gothic form by a strait band of fascia,
is a series of small circular arches: an intermixture and
arrangement of the two forms that characterize the earliest use
of Gothic architecture.&nbsp; Two lofty arches, rising from the
middle of the church, still sustain a massive portion of the
tower, whose doubtfully poised and ponderous bulk seriously
menaces the adventurous explorer of the ruin.&nbsp; The grandeur
of the western front cannot be passed unnoticed; nor, looking
over the fragments of the choir, the fine view <a
name="page317"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 317</span>of the
inside ruin, seen through the great eastern arch of the tower;
neither is a small chapel adjoining the south transept, with a
well-formed engrained roof, to be neglected: the transept is
remarkable for a large Norman archway that led into the south
aile of the choir.</p>
<p>Many portions of building appear in detached heaps near the
abbey church, particularly a bold arch in a neighbouring barn,
which seems to have formed the principal entrance to the
abbey.&nbsp; Among these the natives point out a low
subterraneous passage, faced with hewn stone, which they suppose
to have had a connexion with Old Castle, about three miles
distant.</p>
<p>St. David, the uncle of king Arthur (say ancient legends), was
so struck with this sequestered recess, then almost unconscious
of a human footstep, that he built a chapel on the spot, and
passed many years in it as a hermit.&nbsp; William, a retainer of
the earl of Hereford&rsquo;s in the reign of William Rufus, being
led into the valley in pursuit of a deer, espied the
hermitage.&nbsp; The deep solitude of the place, and the
mysterious appearance of the building, conspired to fill him with
religious-enthusiasm; and he instantly disclaimed <a
name="page318"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 318</span>all worldly
enjoyments for a life of prayer and mortification.</p>
<p>In a curious account of the abbey, written by one of its
monks, which is preserved in Dugdale&rsquo;s Monasticon, and
translated into English by Atkyns, in his History of
Gloucestershire, it is recorded, that &ldquo;He laid aside his
belt and girded himself with a rope; instead of fine linen, he
covered himself with hair-cloth; and instead of his
soldier&rsquo;s robe, he loaded himself with weighty irons.&nbsp;
The suit of armour, which before defended him from the darts of
his enemies, he still wore as a garment to harden him against the
soft temptations of his old enemy Satan; that, as the outward man
was afflicted by austerity, the inner-man might be secured for
the service of God.&nbsp; That his zeal might not cool, he thus
crucified himself, and continued this hard armour on his body
until it was worn out with rust and age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His austerity of life, and sanctity, not only drew to him a
colleague (Ernesi, chaplain to Maud wife of Henry the First), but
excited the reverence of many high characters, and <a
name="page319"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 319</span>induced
Hugh de Laci, earl of Hereford, to found a priory of regular
canons of the order of St. Austin on the site of the
Hermitage.&nbsp; The institution adopted William&rsquo;s
mortifying system, and its reputation occasioned numerous
donations to be offered; but they were constantly refused, and
the acquisition of wealth deprecated as a dreadful
misfortune.&nbsp; William was determined &ldquo;to dwell poor in
the house of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; The monk of Lanthony comically
relates, that &ldquo;Queen Maud, not sufficiently acquainted with
the sanctity and disinterestedness of William, once desired
permission to put her hand into his bosom; and when he with great
modesty submitted to her importunity, she conveyed a large purse
of gold between his coarse shirt and iron boddice; and thus by a
pleasant and innocent subtlety administered some comfortable
relief to him.&nbsp; But oh the wonderful contempt of the
world!&nbsp; He displayed a rare example, that the truest
happiness consists in possessing little or nothing!&nbsp; He
complied, indeed, but unwillingly, and only with a view that the
queen might employ her devout liberality in adorning the
church.&rdquo;&nbsp; His scruples thus overcome, <a
name="page320"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 320</span>a new
church on a more magnificent plan was erected (that which now
appears); it soon displayed the usual pomp of the craft, and in
less than thirty years the monks came to one opinion, that
&ldquo;the outward man&rdquo; deserved consideration; that the
&ldquo;place was unfit for a reasonable creature, much less for
religious persons:&rdquo; nay some said, that &ldquo;they wished
every stone of the foundation, &ldquo;a stout hare;&rdquo;
others, still more wicked, &ldquo;that every stone was at the
bottom of the sea.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hence, in the year 1136, we find
a new Lanthony abbey built and consecrated near Gloucester,
which, although at first only a cell to our abbey, soon assumed a
priority over the parent foundation.&nbsp; The treasures,
library, rich vestments, and even bells, were removed to the new
house: the old Lanthony then came to be considered as a prison by
the fat monks of the Severn, who sent thither only &ldquo;their
old and useless members.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In doleful mood the monk complains, &ldquo;We are made the
scum and outcast of the brethren.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;They
permitted the monastery to be reduced to such poverty, that the
friars were without surplices, and <a name="page321"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 321</span>compelled to perform the duties of
the church against the customs and rules of the order.&nbsp;
Sometimes they had no breeches, and could not attend divine
service.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus it appears, that eventually the
condition of the monks, though sore against their wills, reverted
to the intention of their founder.&nbsp; The monastery continued
in this unthriving state till the dissolution of those concerns;
when, according to Dugdale, the abbey near Gloucester was valued
at 648<i>l.</i> 19<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i> and this in Monmouthshire
at 71<i>l.</i> 3<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Oldcastle</span>, a little village on the
eastern slope of the Black mountains which skirt the vale of
Ewias on the right, is supposed by Gale and Stukeley to have been
the ancient Blestium, but upon grounds that are very
inconclusive: true it is, however, that several encampments near
the spot wear a Roman character, and they were in the habit of
raising such camps near their station.&nbsp; But the place is
more noticed as having been the residence of Sir John Oldcastle,
Lord Cobham, the companion of Henry the Fifth, and afterwards
chief of the Lollards, and martyr to their religious views.&nbsp;
His ancient mansion, called the court-house, was taken <a
name="page322"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 322</span>down about
thirty years ago; so that nothing now remains to satisfy the
antiquary.</p>
<p>But the picturesque traveller will hardly fail of a lively
interest, while, traversing the superior heights of the
neighbouring mountains, he views the grand extent of the
Monmouthshire wilds, and traces the different combinations of its
majestic hills, which in some parts range into the most sinuous
forms, in others extend for many miles into direct longitudinal
ridges; or, when, withdrawing from the sterile dignity of the
high lands, his eye gratefully reposes on the gentle vallies that
sweep beneath their brows, enlivened by glistening streams, and
rich in all the luxuriance of high cultivation.</p>

CWM-DUR&mdash;LLANDOVERY CASTLE&mdash;ROAD FROM BRECON TO
HEREFORD&mdash;BRUNLYSS CASTLE&mdash;FEMALE
VENGEANCE&mdash;HAY&mdash;CLIFFORD CASTLE.</p>
<p>The road from Abergavenny to Brecon, bordering the clear and
lively Usk in a romantic valley, soon leaves the charming county
of Monmouth; but is attended with such a continuance of agreeable
scenery as may diminish in a considerable degree the regret of
the tourist.&nbsp; Among the verdant accompaniments of the
serpentizing river, the rich groves and smiling lawns of Dany <a
name="page324"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 324</span>Park are
conspicuous, swelling above a fertile vale, and backed by a range
of wild mountains.&nbsp; Nearly opposite this, in a field to the
right of the road and the fifteen mile-stone from Brecon, is a
single upright stone, about fourteen feet high, conjectured to be
a monument of the druidical ages.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Crickhowell</span>, about two miles
farther, is an old mean-built town; but, hanging on the steep
declivities of a fine hill, and dignified with the picturesque
ruin of a castle, it is an interesting object in the
approach.&nbsp; The extent of this fragment of antiquity (of
obscure origin), sometimes called Alashby Castle, is by no means
considerable; the foundation of the keep, seated on a high
artificial mound, denotes much original strength, and all the
standing walls shew a very remote erection; although a few
enrichments of later times may be perceived beneath the
thickly-woven ivy.&nbsp; A narrow Gothic bridge crosses the Usk
here to the pleasing village of Langottoc, the neighbourhood of
which is enlivened with several handsome seats; but no one is
more remarkable for the excellence of its position and the
singularity of its design <a name="page325"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 325</span>than a lately-erected residence of
Admiral Gell&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The road continues scenic and entertaining to the small
village of <span class="smcap">Tretower</span>, only to be
noticed for a few picturesque fragments of its castle, once the
residence of Mynarch lord of Brecon.&nbsp; Then winding round a
conical eminence, the road ascends a mighty hill called the
Bwlch, which term signifies a rent in a mountain: during which
ascent, a farewel view of the vale of the Usk, with a small
tributary valley, and its appendant stream descending from some
gloomy mountains to the north, and joining it near the castle of
Tretower, is truly interesting and grand.&nbsp; But from these
wide-ranging views, and all external scenery, the tourist becomes
shut up on entering the pass of the mountains, a sterile hollow,
from which he emerges on a subject of an entirely opposite and
very singular description.&nbsp; Surrounded by dark mountains,
melancholy and waste, appears an extensive lake called <span
class="smcap">Langor&rsquo;s Pool</span>, upwards of six miles in
circumference; which, as the natives assure you, is the site of a
large city swallowed up by an earthquake, and is <a
name="page326"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 326</span>so well
furnished with perch, tench, and eels, as to be one-third fish to
two-thirds water.</p>
<p>In the neighbourhood of the lake north-eastward, and near the
head of the Lleveny brook, which empties itself into the pool, I
find described the ruins of <span class="smcap">Blaen-Lleveny
Castle</span>.&nbsp; It was fortified by Peter FitzHerbert,
descended of Bernard de Newmarch, lord of Brecon, according to
the opinion of some antiquaries, upon the site of the Roman
Loventium.</p>
<p>The road soon descends to the fine vale of Brecon, grandly
accompanied by a semicircular range of mountains; where, proudly
rising in superior majesty, the Van rears its furrowed and
bipartite summit high above the clouds.&nbsp; Advancing,
cultivation takes a more extensive sweep, and picturesque
disposition becomes frequent.&nbsp; The Usk flowing round the
foot of the Bwlch, cloathed with the extensive plantations of
Buckland-house, salutes the beholder with renewed attractions;
and farther up the vale laves the charming woody eminence of
Peterstone in its sinuous career.</p>
<p>On the left of the road, about five miles from Brecon, is a
stone pillar, six feet in <a name="page327"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 327</span>height, and nearly cylindrical; on
which is an inscription that Camden read, N--- FILIUS VICTORINI,
but which is now almost obliterated.&nbsp; He supposes it a
monument of later ages than the Romans, although inscribed with
their characters, and wearing the general appearance of a Roman
<i>cippus</i>.&nbsp; In the parish of Llahn Hamwalch, standing on
the summit of a hill near the church, (which is to the left of
the road a little beyond the former monument) I find described
St. Iltut&rsquo;s hermitage, composed of four large flat stones;
three of which, standing upright, are surmounted by the fourth,
so as to form a sort of hut, eight feet long, four wide, and
nearly the same in height.&nbsp; This kind of monument is called
a Kist-vaen, a variety of the Cromlech order, and supposed to
have been applied to the same purposes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brecon</span> is delightfully situated
upon a gentle swell above the Usk, overlooking a fertile
highly-cultivated valley enlivened with numerous seats, and
enriched with several sylvan knolls.&nbsp; On one side of the
town, beneath the majestic hanging groves of the priory, the
impetuous Hondy loudly murmurs, <a name="page328"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 328</span>and unites with the Usk a small
distance beyond its handsome bridge.&nbsp; Though the town boasts
many capital residences, yet, encumbered by a number of mean
hovels even in its principal situations, and deficient in
regulations of cleanliness, it fails to create any idea of
importance.&nbsp; Its once magnificent castle is now curtailed to
a very insignificant ruin; and that little is so choaked up with
miserable habitations, as to exhibit no token of antique
grandeur: some broken walls and a solitary tower compose its
remains.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brecon Castle</span> was founded by
Bernard de Newmarch in the reign of William Rufus.&nbsp; Llewelyn
prince of Wales besieged it when asserting the rights of his
ancestry and friends, but without success.&nbsp; Passing through
the hands of the Braoses and Bohuns, it fell to the king-making
Buckingham, when it became the seat of chivalric splendour.&nbsp;
To his care Dr. Morton, bishop of Ely, was committed by Richard
the Third; and the remaining turret is still called Ely tower by
the natives, and described to have been his prison.&nbsp;
Buckingham, fired with resentment <a name="page329"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 329</span>by the ingratitude of Richard, whom
he had raised to power, contrived, with his prisoner, in this
place, the means of his overthrow.&nbsp; The plot succeeded, but
the duke was betrayed and taken before its completion, and lost
his head: the more wary priest retired in secresy during its
operation, and preserved his to wear the metropolitan mitre in
the ensuing reign.&nbsp; Bernard also founded a Benedictine
priory for six monks westward of the town; it was dedicated to
St. John, subordinate to Battle abbey in Sussex, and became
collegiate under Henry the Eighth.&nbsp; The church is a grand
cruciform building, 200 feet in length by 60 in width, and has an
embattled tower 90 feet high rising from the centre of the
building.&nbsp; A cloister extends from the church to the
priory-house; where the tourist, as he paces the refectory, or
great dining-room, may speculate on monkish carousals, where
blue-eyed nuns, were jovially toasted, and secret confessions
anticipated.</p>
<p>But the most fascinating attraction of the town is its two
delightful walks: the one traced on the margin of the noble Usk;
the other, called the priory walk, a luxuriant <a
name="page330"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 330</span>grove
impendent over the brawling Hondy, once assigned to the
meditations of monkish fraud, but now more happily applied to the
use of the townspeople, and enlivened on fine evenings by a
brilliant promenade of Cambrian beauties.</p>
<p>This town, built on the site of a Roman station, <a
name="citation330"></a><a href="#footnote330"
class="citation">[330]</a> was originally called
Aber-Hondy.&nbsp; After the departure of the Romans, the lordship
of Brecon remained in the hands of the Britons till the reign of
William Rufus; when Bernard de Newmarch, a Norman baron of great
skill and prowess, having assembled a large body of troops, made
a successful inroad into the country, killed the British chief
Bledhyn ap Maenyrch, and retailed his son prisoner in Brecon
castle during his life; though he, at the same time, allowed him
a nominal share of his father&rsquo;s territories.&nbsp; He then
fortified the town with a castle, and an encircling wall, having
three gates; and further <a name="page331"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 331</span>strengthened his cause by taking to
wife Nesta, grand-daughter of Gruffyth prince of Wales.</p>
<p>A road passing from Brecon through Llandovery to Llandilo, in
Caermarthenshire, we did not travel; but find it described as
highly picturesque, and otherwise interesting.&nbsp; For several
miles it traverses an undulating district enlivened by the Usk;
which now, approaching its source in the Trecastle hills, assumes
all the impetuosity of a mountain torrent.&nbsp; The spacious
lawns, long avenues of trees, and extensive plantations of
Penbont, grace the bonders of the stream about three miles from
Brecon; and on the left of the road, a small distance further,
appear the trifling remains of Davenock castle.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Trecastle</span>, ten miles from Brecon, a small
village but possessing a good inn, is deprived of every vestige
of its ancient fortification.&nbsp; From this place the road
winds for nine miles to Llandovery, in a deep valley, between the
mountains, called <span class="smcap">Cwm-Dwr</span>, a romantic
pass watered by a lively stream, and dotted with numerous
cottages, whose fertile hollow is beautifully contrasted by the
wild aspect of <a name="page332"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
332</span>the impendent heights.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Llandovery</span> is a small irregular town, nearly
encompassed by rivulets, and only to be noticed by the
picturesque traveller for the small ruins of its ivy-mantled
castle.&nbsp; The road then continues to Llandilo on a high
terrace, ornamented on the right by the groves of Taliaris and
Abermarle parks, and overlooking the upper vale of Towey, rich in
cultivation and the beauty of its stream.</p>
<p>On the road to Hereford from Brecon, about seven miles, is
<span class="smcap">Brunlyss Castle</span>; the principal and
almost only feature of which is a high round tower on an
artificial mount.&nbsp; Its foundation is uncertain, but cannot
be later than the first settlement of the Normans in the
county.&nbsp; There is a curious circumstance connected with an
incident in the history of this castle, which I think very
probably suggested the character of Faulconbridge in
Shakespeare&rsquo;s play of King John.&nbsp; The acknowledged son
and heir of Bernard de Newmarch and his wife Nesta was Mahel, a
dauntless, youth, who, after the death of Bernard, having
affronted a paramour of his mother&rsquo;s, and upbraided the
matron herself, <a name="page333"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
333</span>became in a most extraordinary manner deprived of his
inheritance.&nbsp; Nesta, enraged at the interference of her son
in her tender arrangements, presented herself before Henry the
Second, and solemnly made oath that he was not the son of Bernard
lord of Breton; but was begotten by a Cambrian warrior, thereby
proclaiming her son a bastard, and satisfying her revenge, though
at the expence of every maternal tie and of the strongest
sentiments of female worth.&nbsp; Bernard&rsquo;s estates, in
consequence, fell to his daughter Sibyl wife of Milo earl of
Hereford; and Mahel, ejected from his patrimony, became a lawless
desperado.&nbsp; Once, as he was on a predatory excursion over
the domains of David Fitzgerald, bishop of St. David&rsquo;s, he
was entertained by Walter de Clifford in Brunlyss Castle for one
night; when the building took fire, and he, in endeavouring to
escape, was crushed to death by the falling of a stone.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hay</span>, a small populous town on this
road, at the extremity of the principality, occupies an eminence
near the banks of the Wye, and was formerly graced with a fine
castle, <a name="page334"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
334</span>which is now reduced to a few broken walls; but <span
class="smcap">Clifford</span>, a mile or two further, on the
upper road to Hereford, still exhibits the majestic remains of
its castle, crowning a bold hill which towers above the river,
and has been long renowned as having been the birth-place of the
lovely, but frail fair Rosamond.</p>

<p>Proceeding northward from Brecon, the road passes over an
abrupt succession of hills and hollows near the impatient Hondy,
which is seen to extend for several miles through a wild romantic
valley.&nbsp; On leaving the lively rivulet&rsquo;s devious
course, the road traverses an extensive hilly tract, from whose
summits a grand expansive valley, dignified with the sinuous Wye,
bursts upon the view in a long continuance of varied
scenery.&nbsp; The town of Bualt occupies a spot on the nearmost
side of the vale, overhanging the pride of Welch rivers; and
beyond its opposite <a name="page336"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 336</span>hilly boundary, a majestic outline
of distant mountains defines the horizon.&nbsp; A picturesque
cascade, rushing through a portal of rocks and woods to the left
of the road, must not be passed unnoticed; it occurs within a
mile of Bualt; and after crossing the road beneath its bridge,
the stream unites with the Wye.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bualt</span> is a small market-town
comprised in two streets rising one over the other, upon the high
shelving bank of the river.&nbsp; Although anciently and
irregularly built, it is much resorted to by the neighbouring
gentry, not less for the beauty of its position, than for the
famed salubrity of its air.&nbsp; Camden supposes it to be the
Bullacum Silurum of Ptolemy, and the Burrium of Antoninus.&nbsp;
Horseley, on the other hand, fixes upon Usk in Monmouthshire as
the site of that Roman station; while other antiquaries contend
in favour of Caerphilly.&nbsp; However this may have been, the
only vestige of high antiquity that now marks the place is a
mound, the site of the keep of its castle, which was burnt down
in 1690.</p>
<p>It was in the neighbourhood of Bualt, between the Wye and its
tributary stream the <a name="page337"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 337</span>Irvon, that the Cambrian warriors
made their last stand for independence.&nbsp; The brave
Llewelyn,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Great patriot hero, ill-requited
chief,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>after a transient victory at the foot of Snowdon, led his
troops to this position, where they were unexpectedly attacked
and defeated by the English forces, while Llewelyn, unarmed, was
employed in a conference with some chieftains in a valley not far
distant.&nbsp; The prince was informed of the event by the cries
of his flying army; and all that prompt intrepidity could effect
he exerted to rejoin his men; but in vain; the spear of his enemy
pierced his side, and happily spared him the anguish of
witnessing the irretrievable ruin of his country&rsquo;s
liberties.</p>
<p>Edward&rsquo;s conduct to the body of this prince, royal like
himself, of a lineage still more ancient and noble, and who
boldly fell asserting the rights of his country and inheritance,
has affixed a blot on his memory, which not all his
well-regulated ambition, not all the splendour of his victories,
can gloss over, or efface from the page of history.&nbsp; The
prince&rsquo;s head was received in London with such
demonstrations <a name="page338"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
338</span>of joy by the citizens, as might have suited a conquest
over a predatory invader; it was carried on the point of a lance
through Cheapside; and, after having been fixed in the pillory,
was placed on the highest part of the tower of London, to glut
the eyes of the multitude.&nbsp; So easy is it to impose on the
natural feelings of a people once cajoled into an approval of
military despotism and cruelty.</p>
<p>On leaving Bualt, and crossing its bridge, the tourist enters
<span class="smcap">Radnorshire</span>, where the road, traced
upon heights impendent over the Wye, commands one of the most
beautifully romantic vallies in the principality.&nbsp; The
river, which we have before seen majestically flowing, rapid but
unopposed, among flowery lawns, here, approaching its native
source in the bosom of Plinlimmon, appears eddying, foaming, and
roaring in a narrow channel, amid shelving rocks and disjointed
craigs, a mere mountain torrent.&nbsp; With the accompaniments of
towering precipices, naked rocks, and impendent cliffs, finely
softened by overhanging branchy trees, or partially concealed by
deep shadowy woods, and frequently enlivened by a stripe <a
name="page339"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 339</span>of verdant
meadow, the river presents a succession of picturesque
<i>mor&ccedil;eaus</i>, the most striking imaginable; and fully
compensates the bad state of the road in this part.&nbsp; A
considerable range of prospect also presents itself on the right,
from some favoured eminences, where a long series of moorish
lumpy hills extend over the greater part of Radnorshire, which
shews but an indifferent mixture of cultivation with numerous
heaths and forests.</p>
<p>An extensive mountainous dreary region,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Where woods, and wilds, and thorny ways
appear,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>occupies part of the counties of Brecon, Cardigan, and Radnor,
westward of the Wye.&nbsp; Among these deep solitudes, Camden
informs us, king Vortigern sought a refuge from the persecutions
that his crimes and follies raised against him.&nbsp; His
ultimate fate is wrapped in uncertainty; but his vileness needed
not a more agonizing torture than his wounded conscience, whether
recurring to his incestuous intercourse with his own offspring,
or to his miserable policy in resting the defence of Britain upon
the assistance of foreign troops.</p>
<p><a name="page340"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 340</span><span
class="smcap">Rhayder-gowy</span>, wildly situated at the foot of
the mountainous barrier between South and North Wales, consists
of two streets of neatly whitened houses, and is graced with the
vicinity of two churches.&nbsp; A castle also added to the
consequence of the town in the time of the Welch princes; but
none of its remains now appear, except a deep trench cut in the
rock of the town, and three or four barrows, which are, no doubt,
connected with its history.&nbsp; The market-house is a neat
little building, though of rough stones; and the Red Lion inn is
no less remarkable for its neatness and accommodation, useful
though unimposing, than for the obliging assiduities of its
landlord.</p>
<p>The scenery of the Wye, close to this town, acquires an
uncommon degree of grandeur.&nbsp; Raging in its rocky bed, the
river is seen through the light foliage of impendent trees, and
almost beneath a bold arch which bestrides the river, bounding
over a ledge of rock in a fall of some depth; whence it tears its
way among protruding craigs in a sheet of glistening foam, but is
almost immediately concealed by the embowering ornaments of its
banks.</p>
<p><a name="page341"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 341</span>Above
the town of Rhayder, a bold hilly region, overspread with
treacherous bogs, or broken into precipices of fearful depth,
mixes with the magnificent forms of the North Wales
mountains.&nbsp; Here nature wears her wildest garb; no stripe of
cultivation controls the dreary majesty of the scene; the
mountain sheep browse on the dizzy heights unmindful of danger;
the hardy ponies here sport away their early years, unconscious
of restraint; and, no less free, the bold mountaineer looks round
his stormy world, nor hapless mourns the gayer spheres below:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But calm, and bred in ignorance and
toil,<br />
Each wish contracting, fits him to the soil.<br />
Cheerful at morn, he wakes from short repose,<br />
Breathes the keen air, and carols as he goes;<br />
At night returning, every labour sped,<br />
He sits him down the monarch of a shed;<br />
Smiles by his cheerful fire, and round surveys<br />
His children&rsquo;s looks, that brighten at the blaze;<br />
While his lov&rsquo;d partner, boastful of her hoard,<br />
Displays her cleanly platter on the board:&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such are the charms to barren states assign&rsquo;d,<br
/>
Their wants but few, their wishes all confin&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This district is, however, rich in mineral treasure; and
several lead-mines, and one or <a name="page342"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 342</span>two copper-mines, are worked with
considerable spirit.</p>
<p>Here my observations upon South-Wales draw to a close: they
have been very brief upon Radnorshire; and yet the excursion on
the banks of the Wye describes almost its only attraction.&nbsp;
Indeed, this county is remarkably barren in subjects of
picturesque beauty, memorials of antique grandeur, and remarkable
towns and villas.&nbsp; I find but one religious house in this
shire described in Dugdale&rsquo;s Monasticon, or Tanner&rsquo;s
Notitia Monastica, which is Abbey Cwm Hir, situated about six
miles east of Rhayder; but I understand that no part of the
building remains.&nbsp; It was founded for Cistercian monks by
Cadwathelan ap Madoc in the year 1143, and must have been a very
inconsiderable foundation, as its revenues at the suppression of
monasteries were only valued at 28<i>l.</i> 14<i>s.</i>
4<i>d.</i></p>
<p>The castles that occur in this county are neither remarkable
in their history nor venerable in decay.&nbsp; Yet frequent and
memorable are the earthen works that characterize almost every
hill in the county, which <a name="page343"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 343</span>either wear the marks of cairns <a
name="citation343"></a><a href="#footnote343"
class="citation">[343]</a> or ancient encampments.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas on those downs, by Roman hosts
annoy&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fought our bold fathers, rustic, unrefin&rsquo;d!<br
/>
Freedom&rsquo;s fair sons, in martial cares employ&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They ting&rsquo;d their bodies but unmask&rsquo;d
their mind.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On a hill near Knighton, at the eastern limit of the county,
is still shewn the <span class="smcap">Camp of Caractacus</span>;
and an encampment on another hill separated from the first by a
deep valley, is said to be that of the Roman general
Ostorius.&nbsp; The Britons waited the attack of the
enemy&rsquo;s legions in their advantageous position, and fought
like men who valued life no longer than as it was connected with
freedom; but their courage availed nothing before the skill and
discipline of the Roman army; after an immense slaughter they
gave way, and Caractacus&rsquo;s wife, daughter, and brothers,
were taken prisoners.&nbsp; The king escaped, but was soon after
betrayed <a name="page344"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
344</span>into the hands of his enemies.&nbsp; His noble speech
and deportment when brought before the Roman emperor, as
transmitted to us by the pen of Tacitus, must ever excite
admiration, and evince the immutable dignity of manly virtue,
however bereft of the factitious splendour of power.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Offa&rsquo;s Dyke</span> also passes near
Knighton; the boundary established by Offa king of the Mercians
between his dominions and Wales, after a decisive victory over
the Britons.&nbsp; It formerly extended from the Dee to the mouth
of the Wye; and it was enacted, that any Welchman found in arms
on the English side of the boundary should have his right hand
cut off.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Knighton</span> itself I find
described to be an ordinary town, built on a steep bank of the
Teme.&nbsp; Seven miles southward of it is <span
class="smcap">Presteign</span>, a better built and paved town
than the former, and graced with a beautiful little eminence (the
site of its castle), laid out in public walks.&nbsp; This town is
considered as the modern capital of the county: in it are held
the assizes; and, having the jail, it is farther distinguished
with all the apprehended rogues in Radnorshire.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Old Radnor</span>, three or four miles farther <a
name="page345"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 345</span>southward,
Camden supposes to have been the Magoth of Antoninus, garrisoned
by the Paciensian regiment in the reign of Theodosius the
younger; but, whatever it may have been formerly, it now appears
an insignificant village.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">New
Radnor</span>, though nominally the capital of the shire, is
little better; yet a few vestiges of an encompassing wall and a
castle give it more unequivocal marks of former importance than
the parent town.&nbsp; Its decline is dated from the rebellion of
Owen Glendower, who destroyed the castle and ravaged all the
surrounding district.&nbsp; In a rocky glen, in the vicinity of
this town, is a fine cascade, though of inconsiderable volume,
called <span class="smcap">Water breaks its Neck</span>.</p>
<p>Crossing Radnor forest, an extensive tract of sheep down and
coppice, about twelve miles from New Radnor, and seven from
Bualt, is <span class="smcap">Llandrindod Wells</span>.&nbsp;
This place, consisting only of one house of public entertainment
and a few cottages, appears to be justly distinguished for the
efficacy of its springs, which are chalybeate, sulphureous, and
cathartic.&nbsp; But though the medicinal virtues of these waters
be undoubted, and considered even more potent than those of <a
name="page346"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 346</span>Harrowgate;
yet the place, being dreary, remote, and void of elegant
accommodation, is only visited by a very few real invalids: none
of that gay tribe is here to be met with which forms the
principal company at watering-places in general.</p>
<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Having thus executed my design of a general description of
South-Wales and Monmouthshire, I shall return to the narrative of
my tour.</p>

347</span>CHAP. XXIII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">GOODRICH CASTLE AND PRIORY&mdash;WILTON
CASTLE&mdash;SCENERY OF THE WYE FROM ROSS TO
MONMOUTH&mdash;ROSS&mdash;GLOUCESTER.</p>
<p>We took our farewel leave of Monmouth on a hazy morning, that
concealed the surrounding scenery in the earliest part of our
ride to Gloucester.&nbsp; But the mist gradually withdrawing
allowed us a gleam of the majestic Wye, about two miles from
Monmouth; which, soon deserting the course of the road, winds
beneath the bare rocky cliffs of the little Doward, and becomes
lost among high wooded hills.&nbsp; Near the seven-miles stone
from Monmouth we struck off the turnpike into an embowered lane
in search of <span class="smcap">Goodrich Castle</span>, a very
picturesque ruin, which rises among tufted trees on a <a
name="page348"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 348</span>bold
eminence above the Wye.&nbsp; The view of the castellated hill,
combined with a grand fertile valley, which extends for many
miles in a richly-variegated undulation, enlivened with the
elegant though simple spire of Ross church, and with peculiar
graces, watered by the copious river, was uncommonly striking:
while to the right we caught a glimpse of the grand features
about Symonds-gate and the Caldwell rocks, backed by a range of
heathy hills that forms the boundary of the forest of Dean.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p348b.jpg">
<img alt=
"Goodrich Castle"
title=
"Goodrich Castle"
src="images/p348s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The remains of this castle shew it to have been of
considerable strength, though not very extensive.&nbsp; Its
figure is nearly square, measuring fifty-two yards by
forty-eight, with a large round tower at each angle.&nbsp; A deep
trench, twenty yards wide, is cut in the rock round the walls,
leaving a narrow ridge which crosses the moat to the grand
entrance.&nbsp; On entering the gateway, a small apartment to the
left, with an ornamented Gothic window, and a stone chalice for
holding holy-water, appears to have been the chapel; or,
considering its small size, rather an oratory.&nbsp; A curious
octagon column rising from a mass of ruins opposite has belonged
to a <a name="page349"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
349</span>principal apartment, and most probably the baronial
hall.&nbsp; A large square tower was the keep, which is said to
have been built by an Irish chieftain named Mackbeth, as a ransom
for himself and his son, who were held prisoners in the castle;
and until lately two ponderous helmets were shewn as belonging to
them, one of which held half a bushel.</p>
<p>There is no doubt but that this was a frontier post held by
the Saxons; and many parts of the ruin still bear a Saxon or
early Norman character. <a name="citation349"></a><a
href="#footnote349" class="citation">[349]</a>&nbsp; During the
reign of king John, and in several succeeding ages, it was in the
hands of the earls of Pembroke, but afterwards deviated from that
line.&nbsp; In Jacob&rsquo;s Peerage, under the article of the
earls of Shrewsbury, it is related, that the Hugh le Despencers
forcibly seized Elizabeth Comyns at Kennington in Surry, and
detained her in confinement above a year; concealing her in their
different castles, until she was, by menaces of death,
constrained to pass &ldquo;her manor of Painswick in the county
of Gloucester to the said earl, the elder Despencer, <a
name="page350"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 350</span>and the
castle of Goodrich to Hugh the younger; to them and their
heirs.&rdquo;&mdash;Thus it was in feudal ages, when every potent
baron dared violate the strongest bands of society; when the
property and freedom of humble individuals, and the honour of
females, were subjected to the will of contiguous power; and
suffering innocence could only plead the wrongs that she suffered
at the tribunal of the oppressor.&nbsp; But, alas! it is a
principle of our being, it is a fact which ought to be treasured
in the minds of Britons, that where power is without controul it
seldom fails to act unjustly.</p>
<p>In the civil wars of Charles the First this castle was in the
hands of both parties successively; and upon the parliamentary
cause proving triumphant, it was ordered to be dismantled: but a
sufficient compensation was allowed to the countess of Kent, to
whom it belonged.&nbsp; The farm-house appertaining to the
meadows and corn-fields about the castle is situated a few
hundred yards from the castle, to the right, and occupies the
site of <span class="smcap">Goodrich Priory</span>: the chapel,
converted into a barn, and some other Gothic remains, are still
visible.</p>
<p><a name="page351"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 351</span>In
our way from Goodrich to Ross, for the first two miles traced in
a bridle road that might with equal propriety be called a ditch,
we had frequent views of the proud ruin towering above its
incircling groves; which, variously combining with the
surrounding landscape at each succeeding station, proved a new
and delightful object.&nbsp; We crossed the Wye at Wilton bridge;
a short distance above which, on the low western bank of the
river, appear the mouldering towers of <span class="smcap">Wilton
Castle</span>, a Norman structure, once the baronial residence of
the Greys.&nbsp; Several pleasure-boats with awnings, handsomely
fitted up for the reception of company that would navigate the
Wye, are moored by the bridge. <a name="citation351"></a><a
href="#footnote351" class="citation">[351]</a></p>
<p>I earnestly advise every traveller of taste and leisure,
proceeding by the way of Ross to Monmouth, not to neglect the
beautiful scenery of this river: he may take one of the boats;
or, if he prefer riding or walking, <a name="page352"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 352</span>he may enjoy its principal charms by
reversing my journey from Goodrich; whence crossing Hensham
ferry, he will proceed among pleasant meadows on the margin of
the stream in front of the sublime grandeur of the Caldwell
rocks; then ascending the isthmus of an immense peninsulated rock
called Symond&rsquo;s gate, at the height of 2000 feet above the
surface of the river, he will enjoy a superlative prospect of its
mazy extent and the grand scenery around.&nbsp; From the vicinity
of Goodrich the Wye urges its course through a narrow valley
inclosed by towering woody mountains, or struggles in more
limited confines, where protruding rocks plunge their naked
perpendicular sides into the body of the stream.&nbsp; Descending
from the lofty neck of the peninsula, which is but six hundred
yards across in a direct line, although the circuit of the river
round the rock is upwards of four miles, he will find himself in
a deep valley of astonishing grandeur, formed on one side by the
romantic precipices of the peninsula, and on the other by the
great Doward, a huge stratified limestone mountain, studded with
lime-kilns and cottages.&nbsp; At the New-wier he <a
name="page353"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 353</span>will
re-cross the river, and soon join the turnpike to Monmouth.</p>
<p>The old town of <span class="smcap">Ross</span>, situated on
the gently-inclining bank of the Wye near Wilton bridge, afforded
us no subject of admiration or interest, except in the
recollection which it excited of Mr. John Kyrle, whose public
spirit and philanthropy inspired the verses of Pope.&nbsp; We
baited our horses at an inn which was formerly his house, and now
bears the sign of &ldquo;The Man of Ross.&rdquo;&nbsp; The views
from the cemetery of Ross church are among the most beautiful
that imagination can picture, looking over a lovely value,
adorned with the majestic meanders of the Wye, enriched with
numerous groves and woods, and finished by a distance of Welch
mountains: to detail its several charming features would be as
tedious, as it would prove a vain attempt to realize a just idea
of the landscape.</p>
<p>We now traversed a well-cultivated district, whose numerous
though gentle hills were frequently clothed with apple-orchards,
and in about six miles ride, upon a wretched road, gained a
heathy eminence, when the great plain of Gloucester appeared
before us, stretching to an immense distance in every <a
name="page354"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
354</span>direction.&nbsp; At the extremity of the plain, at
least in appearance, rose the towers and spires of Gloucester,
faintly relieving from the Cotteswold hills, whose high
continuous summits were strongly contrasted by the broken form of
the Malvern hills afar off on the left.</p>
<p>The Severn, near <span class="smcap">Gloucester</span>,
separates into two channels; which, soon re-uniting, inclose a
tract of land called the Isle of Alney; so that we approached the
city over two bridges connected together by a high causeway near
a mile in length, which traverses the islet.&nbsp; An assemblage
of ships, houses, and numerous spires, greeted us with a look of
more public importance than we had been used to for several
weeks, as we drew near the city.&nbsp; It would require a volume
to give an adequate description of this place: all that my limits
will allow me to say is, that it is one of the fairest cities in
England, regularly composed of four principal wide well-built
streets, meeting at right angles in the middle of the town;
abounding with Gothic churches and other public structures, and a
new-built gaol, which is one of the best in the kingdom.&nbsp;
But its chief ornament <a name="page355"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 355</span>is its truly grand cathedral,
remarkable for its elegant tower, surmounted with four
transparent pinnacles of the most exquisite workmanship, and for
having the largest Gothic window in Britain: nor is it less to be
noticed for the curious ramifications and transomes of its
fretted roof, and the high state of enrichment throughout the
structure. <a name="citation355"></a><a href="#footnote355"
class="citation">[355]</a>&nbsp; We ascended to the summit of the
tower, where</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The bursting prospect spreads immense
around:<br />
And, snatch&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er hill and dale, and wood and
lawn,<br />
And verdant fields, and dark&rsquo;ning heath between,<br />
And villages embosom&rsquo;d soft in trees,<br />
And spiry towns by surging columns mark&rsquo;d<br />
Of household make, your eye excursive roams<br />
To where the broken landscape, by degrees<br />
Ascending, roughens into rigid hills;<br />
O&rsquo;er which the Cambrian mountains, like far clouds<br />
That skirt the blue horizon, dusky rise.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A tributary sigh escaped as we caught the last gleam of our
much-loved principality; <a name="page356"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 356</span>nor can I conclude my subject
without transmitting that view of the Welch individual character
and state of society (particularly alluding to the southern
district), which impressed me during my tour, and which I have
since believed to be just.</p>
<p>Wales may be considered as exhibiting almost the sole remnant
of &ldquo;the good old times&rdquo; existing in Britain.&nbsp;
Separated from those causes of extrinsic splendour which domineer
over other parts of our island, the opulent landholders freely
dispense the wealth of their inheritance with unostentatious
liberality.&nbsp; Indifferent to outward shew, their first cares
evince a parental regard to the poor on their domains, and the
maintenance of their forefathers&rsquo; good cheer.&nbsp; An
interchange of good offices is alike conspicuous between them and
the commonalty; and it is no less pleasing to see the friendly
solicitude of the one, than the unaffected respect and attachment
of the other.</p>
<p>The Welch are justly described to be the most robust and hardy
inhabitants of this kingdom; for, unenervated by those sedentary
employments foisted on less happy regions <a
name="page357"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 357</span>by luxury
and avaricious policy, they boast the vigorous frames of
aboriginal Britons.&nbsp; Although not generally tall, they
possess a more unequivocal criterion of strength, in a fine
breath of chest; and hence it has been remarked, that a Cambrian
regiment drawn up in line covers more ground than any
other.&nbsp; By healthful toil and simplicity of diet
invigorated, they are at once potent, courageous, animated, and
generous.</p>
<p>It has been asserted, that the Welch are averse from
strangers;&mdash;but by whom?&nbsp; By those who have provoked
that aversion; who, carrying with them a vulgar estimation of
superior show at the tables of England, have not known how to
approve a regular board of hospitality, when contrasted by the
splendid profusion of fashionable entertainments; who,
representing the more gay appointments of other resorts, have
pitied the Welchman&rsquo;s old-fashioned furniture, and wondered
how any gentlemanly being could exist in his gloomy Gothic
habitation.&nbsp; Such as can conceive no other travelling
enjoyments than superior inns, sumptuous dinners, and
bowling-green roads, may quarrel with our principality.&nbsp; <a
name="page358"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 358</span>But it is
for those who travel with more enlarged views, and proper
introductions, to declare the ingenuous welcome that they have
experienced: the eager solicitude that was every where manifested
to afford them information; and the liberal fare set before them,
which not even the greatly-increased expence of family
establishments could effectually suppress.</p>
<p>As every virtue has its concomitant shade, we have to lament
that the Welchman&rsquo;s ardent spirit sometimes inclines him to
be quarrelsome; yet, as there is generosity at the bottom, his
passion seldom becomes vindictive.&nbsp; A disposition for social
enjoyment has led him from conviviality to habits of
intemperance; and an improvident hospitality, to the ruin of his
family&rsquo;s fortune.&nbsp; An error more harmless in its
operation arises from his admiration of illustrious ancestry;
which often resolves itself into an association of personal
importance, that unbiassed individuals are not inclined to
allow.&nbsp; These asperities are wearing away, under the
attrition of a more extended and enlightened intercourse.&nbsp;
But it is the heartfelt <a name="page359"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 359</span>wish of an earnest admirer of their
present state of society, equal to every essential duty of a
manly people, that the chilling apathy of morbid refinement may
never paralize their spirit of independence, that spring of
energetic action which forms the noblest attribute of Man.</p>

not having travelled on the road.&nbsp; The church of Kemys

the road, is a small Gothic structure; its cemetery is remarkable
for a hollow yew-tree, fifteen feet in girth, within which is
inclosed an oak not less than seven feet in circumference; its
branches shadow the parent trunk, forming a singular combination
of foliage.&nbsp; The church of Bettus Newydd, on the right of
the road in the same neighbourhood, is noticeable for the entire
state of its ancient rood-loft.&nbsp; A mile and a half further
the road is graced with an elegant Gothic gateway, of modern
execution, appertaining to Clytha house, the seat of William
Jones, Esq.; and near it is Clytha castle, a structure erected by
Mr. Jones to the memory of a beloved wife.&nbsp; At seven miles
from Usk, to the right of the road, is the old mansion of
Lansanfread, a residence of James Green, Esq. M.P., for
Arundel.&nbsp; Colebrook, about two miles further, and nearly the
same distance from Abergavenny, is a seat of Sir John Hanbury
Williams.&nbsp; The house was an irregular old pile, with square
towers at each angle, until about fifty years since, when the
present front and Doric portico were erected, from a design of

a half; but owing to the sinuosity of the river the voyage by
water is near thirty-eight miles.&nbsp; The boats descend with
the current, and are towed all the way back by men: this
laborious task may account for the expensive hire of a boat,
which I understand to be three guineas.</p>

about a mile southward of the town: they are by no means
picturesque, consisting of a series of buildings which surround a
large square area; the dilapidated walls of the chapel are
standing without encumbrance; but the other parts are made up
into farming habitations, with numerous out-houses and sheds.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
